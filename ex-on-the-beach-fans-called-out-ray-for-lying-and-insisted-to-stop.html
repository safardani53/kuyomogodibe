As the conclusion approaches, truth bombs are unleashed and truths are exposed. Where Is The Lie? Ray’s falsehoods were ultimately exposed in this week’s program. Ray stated that he had dug his own grave, despite his belief that he would get away with anything.</p><p>Throughout the season, Ray portrayed Alexis as someone who was strangely clinging to him for no apparent reason. The other couples felt the same way. However, this was due to their ignorance of the fundamental reason. While Ray assumed the cause would be kept concealed, his ex-girlfriend, Alexis, saw through his falsehoods and chose to call him out.&nbsp;Fans who witnessed the show turned to social media to call Ray out on his deception. They demanded that he cease and modify his ways.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ray-2.jpg alt=Ray width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Fans believe Ray should quit lying on Ex On the Beach.</h2><p>Fans complained on Twitter that Ray was deceptive and needed to quit lying. Some people also suggested that he leave Ex On the Beach.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ray gotta stop going to these dating shows and just go on shows that is strictly for challenges ( for the bag) like the challenge.

Meanwhile, she said that he never told her that he wanted her to fight for him. Alexis also expressed her disappointment that he went on another dating program despite knowing she would be devastated. Ray did not tell Alexis the truth, which surprised her. Instead, he said to her,</p><p>“I didn’t want to tell you that because I didn’t want you to blame yourself for my going to a concert I was going to anyhow.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Ray.jpg alt=Ray width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Alexis was taken aback by Ray’s comments and chastised him for not being truthful. During her confession, she also said that Ray should accept responsibility. She said,</p><p>“If he were to accept responsibility, he would say, ‘You know what, Alexis? I manipulated you. I messed with your emotions. I was deceptive and manipulative.’ As though you’re still attempting to defend your views when there are none to defend.”</p><p>The following day, Alexis decided it was time to confront Ray about his falsehoods and clear the air with the other couples who felt she was clinging to Ray for no reason. She said,</p><p>“Before coming here, we had phone s*x twice. That’s why I’ve been up and down and perplexed with him. Because it seemed to be giving me confusing signals to do things like that outside of here. If you don’t tell everyone your whole truth and narrative, it makes me seem insane.”</p><p>While other Ex On the Beach cast members ultimately learned what happened between the two, Ray acknowledged he had planned his fate. During his confession, he said that he had placed himself in that predicament. He stated that he was attempting to remove the burden off his shoulders and wanted to be free of all the shackles and chains of the past.&nbsp;Alexis ultimately decided it was time to take things into her own hands and depart after her epiphany. She informs Ray that she does not want to be with or be friends with him. She went on to say that she would never talk to Ray again.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ex On The Beach</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ray</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicsWWfo3q1tMRmmZ6Zk516p63NrGScmZyhsqV5zq6rZqqRrnqnu9Fmo7Khnpx6orrDZqCnq5mowaawjK2mZqukpL1w</p></div><div id=links><a href=./inaki-angulo-girlfriend-is-he-dating-anyone-explore-his-relationship-timeline.html>&#171;&nbsp;Iaki Angulo Girlfriend: Is He Dating Anyone?
