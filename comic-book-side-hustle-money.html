And the comic books sold during that time have only skyrocketed in value since.</p><p>Vincent recommends others looking to get started in this business to embrace what they like.&nbsp;</p><p>With so many genres of comic books, it’s important to choose what you love, whether that’s superheroes or science fiction.</p><p>“Figure out what your goal is,” Vincent said.</p><p>“Are you doing this because you just want to have fun and collect comic books? Are you doing this as an alternative form of investment?”</p><h2>Getting started</h2><p>From his own comic book collection success, Vincent recommends sticking to a budget for your comic book purchases, but adding in a little discretionary room in case you find something unexpected.</p><p>You should also educate yourself on grading comic books, which essentially just means giving them a specific value based on their quality since publication.</p><p>The closer to perfect condition for the first edition the higher you tend to earn for your comics.</p><p>To get your comic book graded, you have to pay a fee depending on the age and value of the comic.&nbsp;</p><p>This tends to be anywhere from $20 to $120, but comics with a market value of more than $3,000 might charge on sliding scales of three percent of the book’s value.</p><p>Comic book conventions can be especially helpful in first learning the trade because you come across a wide variety of genres and collectors.</p><p>One thing to note is that comic books that are restored in any way will never be worth as much as the originals, so it’s best to avoid these if you’re looking to make a big buck.</p><p>To avoid this, only buy from reputable sources, like comic book auction houses that sell accurately graded books.</p><p>No matter your budget, Vincent believes you can get started and still find cool books to buy.</p><p>Metropolis Collectibles often offers comic books to buy with flexible payment options, including paying the full payment over a few months.</p><p>This opens up the accessibility to collectors who might not have all the cash all at once for a rare and valuable comic.</p><p>Of course, make sure you never spend more than you can afford.</p><h2>High times of the comic book collector</h2><p>Vincent did not share his full income from his collectibles pursuits, but he said he makes more today than he thought he’d ever make in his life.</p><p>The company’s quarterly auctions average $8million.</p><p>“It's allowed me not to make a living, I don't look at it like making a living, I'm looking at it as designing a lifestyle,” Vincent said.</p><p>He’s able to travel the world and lives in New York City’s Greenwich Village, which he believes is one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in the world.</p><p>“Are there people who make millions upon millions upon millions of dollars buying and selling comics and collectibles? Absolutely,” Vincent said.</p><p>“But I will say: money was never my number one goal in being in the comic book business.”</p><p>Vincent said there were so many easier ways to make money in the world than collectibles, but this is what he loves.</p><p>He said: “If I went back to making what I made 20 years ago. I’d still be happy.</p><p>"There's something to be said about feeling every day, when I walk into my office, it feels like Christmas morning.”</p><p>He sees comic books as the perfect combination of commerce and art, and it brings him joy.</p><p>He’s also expanded his comic book empire to include collectibles like video games, VHS tapes and baseball cards.</p><p>Just recently, a baseball card signed by an 8-year-old Mark Zuckerberg sold for more than $120,000.</p><h2>How to know if your comic book is valuable</h2><p>If you have some comic books in your house, there are a few things you can look at to figure out if they're worth some money.</p><p>Almost all comic books have a retail cover price for the time of publication.</p><p>If this price is 10, 12, 20, or 25 cents, it's more likely to be valuable now.</p><p>The issue number is also especially important, as the lower the issue number, the higher the worth.</p><p>There are rare cases like when major characters are introduced that this does not hold true for.</p><p>Currently, top prized comic books are generally from the 1970s or later, so look at the age to tell if you have a shot of selling your book for a big buck.</p><p>And of course, the more pristine condition your comic book is in, the more likely you are to get a high value.</p><p>In order to sell your comics online, you can either go to an in-person dealer or choose an online route like eBay.</p><p>By going through past auctions on eBay, you can easily see how much other issues went for, and price your copy around that.</p><p>When you sell any type of collectible, there are tax implications.</p><p>The profit of any collectible held for more than a year is taxed at 28 percent by the IRS, regardless of any other income.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>For a side hustle you can do in your spare time from home, consider this content creator’s transcription idea that makes <a href=#>up to $3,000 a month.</a></p><p>Or, look into some other side hustles from home: <a href=#>customer care and proofreading.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa4J5f49wbGibn6K2pHnBqKakZaOesaZ5x66qraSVYrqwusSyZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./see-the-gosselin-family-album-200929.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jon, Kate Gosselins Family Album With 8 Kids Over the Years: Pics</a>
