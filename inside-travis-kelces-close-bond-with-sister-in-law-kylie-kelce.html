The little ones quickly grew fond of their “Uncle Trav,” who <a href=#>gushed over his “beautiful” nieces</a> during Kylie’s special episode of the brothers’ “New Heights” podcast in September 2023.</p><p>“This is a Kylie question, Jason, shut the f–k up,” Travis teased on the episode while asking about the couple’s parenting dynamic.</p><p>The trio’s close bond was on full display throughout the podcast, with Kylie frequently making playful jabs at both her husband and brother-in-law. Kylie even joked that Travis — who plays tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs — is an “honorary” member of Jason’s Philadelphia Eagles family.</p><p>“Whenever you come to Philly, [people] say, ‘It’s Jason’s brother!'” she told Travis. “They love you here.”</p><p>While Kylie tends to stay <a href=#>out of the spotlight</a>, she appeared alongside Jason, Travis and their parents — <a href=#><strong>Ed</strong> and <strong>Donna</strong></a> — in the 2023 Prime Video documentary Kelce. Fans have also caught glimpses of her interacting with Jason while he records “New Heights” with his brother virtually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Has-a-Close-Bond-With-Sister-in-Law-Kylie-Kelce-Inside-Their-Relationship-682.jpg><p>In October 2023, <a href=#>Kylie tossed candy at Jason</a> from off camera after asking for chocolates to give trick-or-treaters at their door. As Travis watched the pair butt heads, he said under his breath, “I love Kylie, man. Best sister any guy could ever ask for.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a glimpse inside Travis and Kylie’s close friendship through the years:</p><h3>He’ll Never Forget Her Wedding Day</h3><p>Two months after Kylie and Jason’s wedding, Travis shared photos from the family’s special day. “Throwin’ it back on a Thursday!! Following up a Super Bowl run with a two ring season!! Nicely played Jason… @kykelce I told you this already but you’re the best sister a guy could as[k] for!!” he captioned a June 2018 <a href=#>Instagram</a> slideshow. “I don’t know how but you keep this crazy man in line and you have one of the biggest hearts I know!!”</p><p>He added: “Can’t wait for the future memories we’ll all enjoy together, but here’s a few pics from a day I know I’ll remember forever! 4.14.18.”</p><h3>She Supports the Chiefs — Sometimes</h3><p>When Travis and his team won the 2020 Super Bowl, Kylie celebrated with a sweet photo of daughter Wyatt sporting an “Uncle Trav” outfit. “Feeling so grateful that we got to watch the insanely talented and hardworking @killatrav and the Chiefs win the Super Bowl this past weekend! Wyatt is so proud of her World Champion Uncle!” she gushed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Has-a-Close-Bond-With-Sister-in-Law-Kylie-Kelce-Inside-Their-Relationship-679.jpg><p>Three years later, Kylie and her daughters cheered for Jason <a href=#>when the Eagles took on the Chiefs</a> in the 2023 Super Bowl, which the Chiefs ultimately won. Months later, Kylie revealed on “New Heights” that her kids recognize when Travis is playing. “They understand that when there’s green jerseys on the field that that’s dad,” she said. “And vice versa, they do understand that when there’s a red jersey on the field, that it’s Uncle Travis’ team.”</p><h3>He Takes Her Dating Advice</h3><p>Kylie and Jason reminisced on <a href=#>the beginning of their relationship</a> during her “New Heights” episode in 2023, prompting Travis to joke that he should “get back on” the dating apps. He asked Kylie whether he should use <a href=#>photos of himself with a mustache</a> on his potential profile — and she gave him some tough love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Has-a-Close-Bond-With-Sister-in-Law-Kylie-Kelce-Inside-Their-Relationship-680.jpg><p>“This is going to sound a little harsh, but I think you should do the mustache [in your dating app photos] because if they swipe right at your worst then they’ll love you at your best,” she teased. Travis replied, “That doesn’t even hurt my feelings, that’s just smart.” (He’s continued to rock the mustache while dating Taylor Swift.)</p><h3>She Was a ‘Catching Kelce’ Fan</h3><p>Travis starred on his own Bachelor-style dating series in 2016 titled Catching Kelce — which was filmed “early on” in Jason’s relationship with Kylie. “I will say sitting in the stands and watching that debacle unfold was funny,” Kylie said on “New Heights” in 2023.</p><p>Kylie was referring to the taping of the pilot episode, where 50 women from all 50 states were introduced to Travis. “That was fun, Trav,” she said before Jason mentioned one contestant who was “crying” because it was “so cold” during filming. “Was that not [the girl from] Alaska?” Kylie teased.</p><p>Her recollection of the short-lived series prompted Jason to joke, “Ky, you were really into Catching Kelce! You remember what states everybody was from?”</p><h3>They Aren’t Afraid to Roast Each Other</h3><p>Kylie remembered her “welcome to the Kelce [family] moment” while chatting with Jason and Travis on “New Heights,” describing <a href=#>the 2016 NFL Pro Bowl</a> in Hawaii. “We were there for Travis and it was the first time where everyone [in the family] was in the same place at the same time,” she recalled, noting that it was also the first time she met Travis.</p><p>Travis had his own memories of the “magical” trip, telling listeners that Kylie was “shy” at first — until the group started playing a drinking game. “You were doing the exact same thing Jason was trying to do, which is never really to win the game. It’s really just to trick the f–k out of whoever you’re playing with,” he joked. “And you were doing that with Jason. And I was just like, ‘Oh wow, this is a tag team that is going to threaten America right here.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Has-a-Close-Bond-With-Sister-in-Law-Kylie-Kelce-Inside-Their-Relationship-681.jpg><p>Kylie got in her own playful jab elsewhere in the episode when Travis asked whether he could be trusted with his nieces “unsupervised” for an extended period of time. “But then who’s watching you?” she teased.</p><p>The roasting continued when Kylie returned to the podcast in December 2023 and dropped a subtle reference to his romance with Swift. While discussing their childhood pets, Kylie said she wanted to get a cat, but Jason wasn’t on board. “I feel like you might like cats now,” she told Travis, saying that he should take her side in the debate. (Swift is the proud owner of three cats.)</p><h3>He Supports Her Charity Work</h3><p>The entire Kelce family — including Travis — appeared at the annual Eagles Autism Challenge, which raises money for the Eagles Autism Foundation. Kylie is closely involved with the foundation and was inspired by a childhood neighbor who has autism.</p><p>Travis pressed his sister-in-law further about <a href=#>her dedication to the cause</a> during her 2023 “New Heights” appearance. “I just feel passionately that the Eagles Autism Foundation are doing their absolute best to impact the autism community through programs, through research. … Every single dollar donated goes back to the autism community,” Kylie said, as Travis added, “All the events that you guys throw to raise these funds look absolutely like they are just an absolute blast.”</p><h3>They Gas Each Other Up</h3><p>Kylie signed (and modeled) a limited edition <a href=#>vintage Eagles letterman jacket</a> — similar to the style Princess Diana wore in the ’90s — for a November 2023 auction benefiting the Eagles Autism Foundation. Travis was caught hyping her up in the comments section of the team’s Instagram post, writing, “🗣️Killin it Ky!! 🔥🔥.”</p><p>In its first two days it was up for auction, bids on the autographed jacket peaked at $20,000. It eventually sold for $100,000.</p><h3>They Have Each Other’s Backs</h3><p>During a September 2023 episode of “New Heights,” <a href=#>Jason raised eyebrows</a> (even his brother’s) when he joked that the casual outfit he wore to the Kelce documentary premiere was Kylie’s fault. “I was gonna have jeans on, but Kylie … was running late. I just came straight from football, Kylie was gonna bring the jeans. Kylie was late,” he told Travis, who asked the now-viral question, “Why didn’t Jason bring jeans for Jason?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kylie gave her side of the story while appearing on a holiday-themed episode of the podcast in December 2023. “Jason didn’t bring jeans for Jason because Jason thought that Jason was coming home in between,” she said, adding that her husband “was getting surprised” by an old friend who was visiting for the occasion and didn’t have time to change. “And then I was late, as per usual. … Everybody else was early.”</p><p>Kylie then thanked her brother-in-law for standing up for her in the moment, saying, “The way you had my back was incredible. … I deeply appreciated that.” Jason agreed before Travis quipped, “I wasn’t gonna let this guy do that. Just trying to be a good brother over here.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ506uYr6GjYrimuMKeqmabnKTApnnBqKWdZaeewal50qKqrZ2iYravecuarmajqaG2pnnKnqOcnV8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./michael-greenfield.html>&#171;&nbsp;Michael Greenfield- Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Career, Nationality</a>
