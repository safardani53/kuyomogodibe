But doing that can be a frizzy struggle if you don't know the best curly hair products for you.</p><p>Your unruly ringlets can be smoothed and defined with the best curly hair products, from serums to creams, and there are even specific shampoos and conditioners.</p><p>Curly hair tends to be dryer than straight which means that you need to really nourish it when you do a hair wash. Think moisturising oil cleansers and shea butter shampoo.</p><p>According to Ghanian-born <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wakati Hair</a> expert Jennie Roberts, who has worked with stars like Rita Ora and Ella Eyre, the key is to apply your products to dripping wet hair.</p><p>"My top tip is that hair care should always be in the shower. Don’t leave once you’ve washed and conditioned, utilise that moment to apply everything else too," she explained.</p><p>It's also all about staying hydrated when it comes to curly hair textures. "I find that lots of people throw money at products without thinking about diet," Roberts continued. "A good diet is essential for healthy hair. Hair is mainly made up of proteins so a good balanced diet of protein, iron, vitamins and other nutrients feed your hair deep in the scalp tissue at the blood supply, before the hair appears."</p><p>Caring for curly hair even starts when you're sleeping too. As Roberts told The Sun, "A silk pillowcase or head wrap/bonnet will also help to maintain your texture by avoiding friction when sleeping."</p><p>Looking after your bouncy tresses doesn't have to feel like a whole lifestyle change when you know what you're doing.

For £38, I was a little let down by the 200ml bottle though, as within two hair washes, it had already gone down a fair amount which suggests that you're not supposed to use very much at a time.</p><p>In regards to results? My hair is in that annoying middle between curly and frizzy, so I usually scrunch with curl creme after a shower which makes it difficult to notice the impact of other products.</p><p>However, after using VIRTUE's Curly Conditioner, my hair was noticeably shiny and soft. It gives you a deep condition but not one that's extremely drastic, so don't expect immediate results.</p><p>I imagine after long-term use it might be a bit more effective, so we'll report back in a few weeks.</p><h2>We tested: <strong>OGX Damage Remedy+ Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Capture-2.jpg><ul><li><strong>OGX Damage Remedy+ Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner, £5.35 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>A sweet blend of coconut oil, sweet vanilla bean and tropical flower Tiare, the OGX Damage Remedy+ Coconut Miracle Oil Conditioner is perfect for our curly friends out there.</p><p>Apparently, with a dash of this you can wave goodbye to any frizz and say hello to sleek, smooth fabulousness.</p><p>And I can tell you, it smells great and works a treat.</p><p>Even from the first use, your hair feels nourished, moisturised and light, so your curls aren't weighed down at all.

Start with a leave-in conditioner to control your hair and seal in moisture before you begin the rest styling process.</p><p>Finally, make sure you use a diffuser when drying your hair. It can help even out your curl pattern and boost the volume of heavy curls, giving more body to your hair.</p><p>You can still get lovely soft curls with shorter hair - à la<a href=# rel> Alexa Chung</a> - you just need the right tools.
