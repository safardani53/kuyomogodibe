Getting a man isn’t the problem.</p><p>“It’s once I’ve got them, I just don’t want them to see my body. I know as soon as I take my bra off by boobs are just going to fall to the floor.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here for all our real-life stories and videos</a></p><p>“I could seriously suffocate someone with them. I’ve never felt so low and I hate everything about my body.”</p><p>Many women would enjoy flaunting Anola’s curvy size 12 frame. But her confidence has been shattered by her breasts.</p><p>The security guard has been single since her last relationship ended <b>TEN </b>years ago — and she has not had sex in five.</p><p>And despite being asked out on a daily basis, the mum-of-one always turns fellas down because she feels “fat” and “disgusting”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2018691.main_image.jpg><p>She said: “I can’t hide my breasts. Everything I put on makes me feel like a fat heffalump.</p><p>“I’m jealous of women who have mastectomies. I’d do anything to have mine cut<br>off.”</p><p>Walking down the street, men are quick to spot buxom Anola and often shout remarks such as “Boobs!” and “Milf!”</p><p>Anola, from Ilford, East London, said: “I try to laugh it off as it happens a few times a week.</p><p>“Besides, I think if I was a bloke I’d be thinking the same.</p><p>“As long as they don’t call me a fat cow then they can call me whatever.”</p><p>Now Anola hates her single life and would love to have a boyfriend. Describing herself as “sex mad”, she added that she would need someone who could accept<br>her body.</p><p>She said: “If I’m in a relationship I want sex all the time.</p><p>“I’m so dirty minded and I think like a bloke but the way I look is stopping me from letting go.”</p><p>Over the past ten years, 5ft 6in Anola has visited her GP <b>SEVEN TIMES</b>, begging them for an NHS breast reduction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2018693.main_image.jpg><p>But she claims she has been turned down every time because, at 12st 7lb and<br>with a BMI of 28, she is classed as overweight.</p><p>According to NHS guidelines, a patient’s request for a breast reduction is likely to be refused if their BMI is higher than 27.</p><p>Anola said: “People assume having big breasts is a blessing but it’s nothing of the sort.</p><p>“I weigh more than 12st but because my boobs are so big and heavy, I’m classed<br>as overweight and can’t get the op on the NHS. They should weigh my boobs separately.</p><p>“Why can’t doctors help me if they’re destroying my life?</p><p>“I may not be a cancer victim, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, but I’m depressed and in constant back pain. My breasts are literally ruining my<br>life, every aspect of it.”</p><p>As well as the severe back pain, Anola suffers from hypermobility syndrome — an excruciating joint condition made worse by her chest.</p><p>She takes painkillers every day to cope with the discomfort and says she would do anything to “get rid” of her boobs. But this wasn’t always the case. As a child, Anola was teased by her two older brothers for being flat-chested.</p><p>She said: “When I was younger I used to wish for bigger breasts. Every birthday, I’d make a wish. Now I’d much rather have A-cups.”</p><p>When she turned 13, her dream — now her nightmare — came true.</p><p>She said: “I was ecstatic. Overnight, I went from completely flat-chested to suddenly having full D-cups.</p><p>“By the age of 14, I had bigger breasts than my mum. I thought they would stop growing — I never imagined they’d end up so big.”</p><p>At 21, Anola wore a size 8 — while her breasts were a 34E. Anola added: “I was going through so many bras and it was costing me a fortune. I’d just get a new one and then two weeks later I’d be popping out of it. It became so hard<br>to find tops and clothes that would fit and I ended up having all my bras specially made.”</p><p>After Anola had her son in 2004, she hoped that losing her baby weight would mean losing booby weight.</p><p>However nothing changed and nowadays clothes shopping is nearly impossible — only a size 22 will stretch across her chest.</p><p>She said: “It will take me a whole day of shopping to find just one top to fit me. It’s not a nice experience and really stressful. I stick to black vest tops and cardigans because I don’t want my boobs out and on display. I can’t have nice, fashionable clothes because they don’t fit and I hate looking<br>like a tramp.”</p><p>To this day, Anola’s breasts are still growing and cannot be contained by her current 34LL bra.</p><p>She said: “Big breasts run in my family but I’m the biggest.</p><p>“The last bra I had was a 34LL but now even that’s too small. I don’t even know what to do now or if an M-cup exists.”</p><p>In a last ditch attempt to slim down, Anola started exercising.</p><p>She began cycling ten miles a day but instead of losing weight, she put it on because her flab turned to muscle.</p><p>She said: “Nothing I do seems to help. I only eat one meal a day and I become full after a single cup of coffee — but they just keep getting bigger and<br>bigger.”</p><p>And with a son to support, Anola feels powerless in the face of her daily agony.</p><p>She said: “My chest has got me down so much that I’ve considered having them completely off.</p><p>“I’m a single mother and want to give my son the best of everything so I can’t afford to go privately.</p><p>“I’ve worked hard all my life and paid tax so it’s distressing that the NHS will not do this surgery for me.</p><p>“I won’t ever be able to afford to pay for a private surgeon so I’m just left on my own to deal with this. It’s no quality of life.”</p><h4>How they shape up</h4><p><b>THE </b>world’s biggest natural breasts belong to American Annie Hawkins-Turner, who has a cup size of 102ZZZ.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2018700.main_image.jpg><p>The largest natural boobs in the UK reportedly belong to Claire Smedley, who has 40MMM boobs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2018694.main_image.jpg><p>Last week, Debbie Delamar boasted about her 30KK breasts and said they were Britain’s biggest fake pair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2018696.main_image.jpg><p>Maxi Mounds, from the US, holds the record for world’s biggest fake boobs at 42J.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2018698.main_image.jpg><p><b>Additional reporting: PAISLEY GILMOUR<br></b></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here for all our real-life stories and videos</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5hvcHBvaGS2brTAr5ynrF2drqV50p6vZp6fp3p2ediemKurXZeypK3UrJxmpalir7C7waxkmqqVYsGwu4yboKBn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jodie-foster-wife-alexandra-hedison-attend-emmys-afterparty-cute-pic-2014268.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jodie Foster, Wife Alexandra Hedison Attend Emmys Afterparty: Cute Pic</a>
