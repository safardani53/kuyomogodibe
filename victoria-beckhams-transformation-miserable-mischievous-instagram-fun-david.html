at odds with the miserable-looking public persona she cultivated after joining the Spice Girls three decades ago.</p><p>In 2007, when the band — the world’s biggest-selling girl group ever — reunited for a global concert tour, her bandmate Mel B quipped that Posh Spice “might even smile”.</p><p>Now the woman once dubbed Pouty Spice and Moody Spice is showing she is willing to poke fun at herself and her husband <a href=#>David</a> — as well as revealing her saucy side.</p><p>The 49-year-old has been posting videos on Instagram containing double entendres about “tossing”, “a handsome cock” and being “horny”.</p><p>Mum-of-four Victoria also entertains female followers with photographs of 48-year-old footballer- turned-model David in his underwear, followed by the phrase: “You’re welcome!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Plenty to smile about</h2><p>It was her down-to-earth appearance in last year’s four-part Netflix documentary Beckham that really opened the world’s eyes to Playful Spice.</p><p>In it she danced with the former <a href=#>England</a> captain and laughed off his teasing about her not being as working-class as she claimed.</p><p>The documentary was made by Oscar-winning director Fisher Stevens, who revealed he only accepted the job because of how amused he was by the former singer.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He said: “Victoria was hilarious, really funny. I said, ‘OK, this is going to be good and it’s going to be funny’, because Victoria was so funny when I met her.”</p><p>And she does have plenty to smile about these days.</p><p>The fashion designer’s company, Victoria Beckham Holdings, finally made a profit after 15 years, with sales rising by 44 per cent to £58.8million in 2022, leaving the firm £200,000 in the black.</p><p>The Beckham empire as a whole turned in sales of £130million in a year, largely from brand partnerships and licensing deals, with the Netflix documentary and David’s ambassador role at football’s World Cup also helping to fill the coffers.</p><p>Victoria also appears to have made up with her son Brooklyn’s wife <a href=#>Nicola Peltz</a>, posing next to the American heiress in a Christmas Day family snap.</p><p>Nicola replied to the Instagram post: “I love you!!”</p><p>On top of that, Victoria and David have clearly overcome any reported rocky moments in their relationship, including his alleged affair with former personal assistant Rebecca Loos 20 years ago.</p><p>In the documentary and on social media the Beckhams, who married in 1999, appear to be closer than ever.</p><p>And they are relaxed enough to rib each other at every opportunity.</p><p>At the weekend Victoria posted an image on her Instagram account, which has 32.6million followers, of the cockerel she bought David for Christmas.</p><p>She added the caption: “Wow what a handsome Cock!!!”</p><p>This followed a video in which Not-so-posh Spice followed her husband around their hen house, saying: “Chickens, and there is actually a massive cock in there as well,” before pausing for comic effect, then adding: “What to get David Beckham for Christmas.”</p><p>And Victoria is something of a repeat offender when it comes to innuendos.</p><p>At the end of October, next to an image of David wearing Devil’s horns she wrote: “HORNY on Halloween.”</p><p>On Shrove Tuesday she made a video of the former Manchester United attacker expertly flipping a pancake in their kitchen, while saying: “It’s Pancake Day and David is tossing away — that’s impressive.”</p><p>She then giggled before adding: “He is so good at tossing,” and when he offered her some honey she joked: “I love some of your sticky stuff.”</p><p>There have been many other posts in which Victoria gently teases her husband.</p><p>She captioned a clip of him exercising on all fours, filmed from behind: “Morning work out with this Love Machine.”</p><p>In a set-up sequence during an interview at the apartment of American fashion designer Jenna Lyons the Wag showed just how waggish she can be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/100e7fbc-5d35-4730-a52a-aa611a5dba50.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3ec97f43-8ed2-4abc-a6fa-6801da0723ce.jpg><p>In a bathroom cabinet Victoria finds a photo of David in just his tight Calvin Klein undies.</p><p>“That’s my husband,” she exclaims, then caresses the image intimately.</p><p>She also shared a photo of David in his underwear beneath the TV and added the caption: “Electrician came to fix the TV... You’re welcome!”</p><p>The pay-off line has become a regular joke.</p><p>Next to a photo of David in his Calvins in an outdoor water tub she wrote: “Let’s all celebrate @davidbeckham!! You’re welcome!”</p><p>Posh has in the past given the impression that she is reluctant to let her hair down.</p><p>But in July on TikTok she let the world see her and David performing karaoke to the Spice Girls song Say You’ll Be There.</p><p>David looks very much the worse for wear, but Victoria claimed: “No really, I did not drink that much.”</p><p>In another clip on Instagram she mocks herself, asking with irony: “Who’d be scared of me?”</p><p>Fans warmed to her openness in the Netflix documentary, particularly when she was shown a newspaper cutting from 2005 with the headline “What would Posh say?” over a photo of David posing with <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> and <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>.</p><p>It was taken the day after he had been unable to attend the birth of their youngest son <a href=#>Cruz</a> via C-section.</p><p>Victoria says: “I’ll tell you what Posh would say, Posh was p***ed off.”</p><p>The series ends with them dancing together to Kenny Rogers and <a href=#>Dolly Parton’s</a> duet Islands In The Stream.</p><p>It’s an emotional moment, which further endeared the couple to viewers, and afterwards Victoria posted: “Still making me laugh and I’m still teaching @davidbeckham to dance.”</p><p>But he has shown he is perfectly able to give as good as he gets, kicking off the New Year with a social media gag at his wife’s expense:</p><p>“Just a nice casual New Year’s Eve lunch at The Ritz. @victoriabeckham Very working class ?? My mother & father in law left in their Roll’s.”</p><p>In the Netflix documentary Victoria said she grew up “working-class”, before David pointed out her dad drove a Rolls-Royce when she was young.</p><p>That gentle everyday joshing was captured by director Fisher Stevens.</p><p>At one point Victoria tells her husband: “I’m heading to the fashion factory,” prompting his reply: “Where are you actually going?” before she smiles and responds: “Facial.”</p><p>It is Victoria’s working life which is really looking up at the moment.</p><p>She has struggled to prove herself in the fashion world since launching her own label in September 2008.</p><p>The company was often in debt and had to find new investors to keep going.</p><p>But her make-up range has proven to be a hit, with her eyeliner receiving particular praise.</p><p>With Victoria’s perfume costing £245 a bottle and one of her tote bags setting customers back £1,450, there is certainly money to be made in her brand.</p><p>Meanwhile, another rumoured problem in her life seems to have been smoothed over.</p><p>It was said that devoted mother Posh had fallen out with her eldest son <a href=#>Brooklyn’s</a> missus over the wedding dress she wore in 2022.</p><p>But in recent photos she is regularly seen getting close to 28-year-old actress Nicola.</p><p>And Victoria is clearly very close to her other three children, sons <a href=#>Romeo</a>, 21, and Cruz, 18, and daughter <a href=#>Harper</a>, 12.</p><p>They all spent most of the festive season together.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>It is hardly surprising, then, that Victoria said at the end of the Netflix documentary: “I feel really content now.”</p><p>And that is certainly coming across in her new Witty Spice persona.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/67f46c0f-4d29-49ae-b5a4-e57a300a2791.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/b26ea82c-ae80-4fbc-8fce-eed9ad7cf2da.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8787a302-5806-40d6-8c96-af17d82f34c3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1999-victoria-adams-victoria-beckham-869551955.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/eroteme-ltd-claim-copyright-image-866334310.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fisher-stevens-attends-netflix-beckham-869596142.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpYGV9dIWXbWavoZOpvLO1wGaZnpubna6uv4ytqZqmo5u8s7nAraCopl2itrSx0ZqZpZ1dora0r8einK%2Bnpah6qrrSrZigqpGieqfBzWabmq6ZmXw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./richard-roundtree-children.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Are Richard Roundtree's Children?
