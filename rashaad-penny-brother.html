He is the second eldest child of five kids to <strong>Robert Penny Sr.</strong> and <strong>Desiree Penny Taplin</strong> (whose birthday is on July 14).</p><p>He grew up with his older brother <strong>Robert Penny Jr.</strong>&nbsp;and three younger siblings: <strong>Rashaad</strong>, <strong>Breonna</strong> (sister), and <strong>Brionne</strong>, chronologically.</p><p>Elijhaa’s brother Robert Jr. played collegiately at the University of Mary in Bismarck, North Dakota; he was born when their father was only 18.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PennySDSU.webp></p><p>The retired NFL player’s youngest sibling, brother Brionne is a college footballer at San Diego State, while insight on his sister Breonna is not out.</p><p>Even though none of the Penny brothers participated in organized football until high school, they would find their interest in the sport later. Thanks to their father who would inspire them to follow their hearts but ‘give everything to it.’</p><p>While Rashaad began <span data-preserver-spaces=true>establishing himself at San Diego State, Elijhaa made his way to the NFL.</span></p><h3>Collegiate Career</h3><p>Elijhaa attended Norwalk High School, where he made a school record of 20 touchdowns in a season as a sophomore.&nbsp;</p><p>The second-eldest of the Penny brothers enrolled at the College of the Sequoias but transferred to the University of Idaho in 2014.</p><p>As a junior, he played 11 games for 589 yards & 12 touchdowns. In 2015, during his senior year, Elijhaa rushed 1159 yards for 10 touchdowns & recorded 239 receiving yards for 2 receiving touchdowns.</p><p>His college stats for 2 varsity years at Idaho averaged 4.5 rushing yards per attempt with 22 touchdowns, 18.5 kick return yards per return & 4 tackles.</p><h2>Elijhaa Penny Undrafted In NFL & Retirement</h2><p>After the 2016 NFL Draft, Elijhaa went undrafted, and later the Arizona Cardinals signed him as UFA (undrafted free agent) on May 9, 2016.</p><p>He rushed 124 yards for four receptions in the 2017 season with the Cardinals after spending his rookie season in the practice squad.</p><p>Later, as a waiver from the <span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cardinals practice squad in 2018, the New York Giants acquired him. As a NY Giants player, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Penny concluded the 2018 season with seven carries for 25 rushing yards and eight receptions for 50 passing yards.</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Elijhaa-Penny-Played-For-NY-Giants-Before-Retired-In-November-2022.jpg></p><p>He would play all of his NFL seasons (2019, 2020 & 2021) with the Giants until retirement on November 28, 2022.</p><p>Elijhaa’s NFL career overall stats read 292 rushing yards with 3 rushing touchdowns & 126 receiving yards for a touchdown through a total of 69 games (starter in only 6).</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meet Rashad Penny, Younger Brother Of Elijhaa&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2018, Brionne Penny frequently traveled to San Diego State to watch his brother Rashaad Penny, a former SDSU running back, compete for the Aztecs.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The younger Penny opted to make the school his home away from home after growing to love it. The Aztecs’ 2019 recruiting class now includes Brionne Penny, an athlete recruited out of Harbor City Narbonne High.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During his two seasons at Norwalk High before transferring to Narbonne in January, Penny was a quarterback with a dual threat.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to Otis Harrison, Penny’s Norwalk coach, the quarterback possessed a rapid release and the ability to throw the ball 70 yards downfield.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Father Was Also An Athlete</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While Robert Sr. downplayed his athletic prowess as a child, Elijhaa said his father was a household name. Robert, Sr. was a three-sport player in his youth.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When Robert became a father at the age of 18, athletics were officially over. But when his five children grew older, Robert encouraged them to pursue their passions. Robert and Desiree now have a daughter, Breonna.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Robert, Sr. watched his boys wreck the neighborhood when they were young, but it was only in the past two years, when he witnessed Elijhaa play at the University of Phoenix Stadium & Rashaad shine with the Aztecs, that he fully understood the severity of their ascent.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Penny Brothers Are Very Supportive Of Each Other</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sometimes, their communication consists of a brief text conversation back and forth. In-depth discussions of the technical details of playing running back in the NFL occur occasionally.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is a text line between Robert & Desiree Penny and their five adult children. Since their middle child plays for the Seahawks, the family’s thread has been particularly active over the past four Sundays.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The parents’ phones have been pinging and ringing at their house in the Los Angeles region almost every time their middle child touches the ball for the team.</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/rahaad-penny-younger-brother-1024x1024.jpg></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rashaad Penny’s torn ACL occurred in the first quarter of the Seahawks game against the Rams on December 8, 2019, in Los Angeles, and the Penny family was present.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And throughout an on-again and off-again recovery process that took Rashaad Penny almost two years to complete, they have been there for him, urging and encouraging him.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Every step of the way, Elijhaa Penny, a drill sergeant and therapist combined, has prodded Rashaad. In Lake Elsinore, California, they bought homes close to one another and exercised every day together during the off-season, exercising and using weights in each other’s garages.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rashad Penny & Elijhaa Penny: Retirement of Jersey</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The NFL stars Elijhaa and his brother Rashaad attended their alma mater Norwalk High School on February 22, 2022, and retired their number 22 jerseys. Additionally, the brothers were given $500 for their 2 Cents Family Foundation.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Pennys’ old instructors, students, and coaches were up to support the two former NHS footballers despite the rain and the chilly 52-degree temperature.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their coach Dean Gray was also in attendance; he has a good connection with the Penny family.</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elijaah-penny.jpg></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tuesday was chosen to commemorate the event because the Pennys’ jersey number 22 & the date February 22, 2022, coincided with 2/22/22, according to coach Jesse Ceniceros.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The brothers honored their former teachers and urged NHS students to keep pursuing their vocations as they retired their #22 jerseys.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Giants fullback was ineligible to enroll directly in a four-year college after high school because he did not fulfill his A-G standards.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rashaad Penny also expressed gratitude to his mentors throughout his career, including his previous instructors. The free agent thanked the NFL free agent Eddie Moreno.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Net Worth Of Elijhaa & His Brother Rashaad Penny</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The New York Giants have a $2,200,000 deal with Elijhaa that will last for the next two years. He has a net worth that ranges from $1 million to $5 million.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, Rashaad’s net worth is projected to be $10.7 million dollars. Since his career is still in its early stages, he can increase his wealth if he puts on an outstanding enough show on the field.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although the 26-year-precise old’s number of sponsors is unknown, Panini does support him. Gaining sponsors correlates directly with the wide receiver’s on-field and team performance. He will snag more sponsors as time goes on.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>FAQs</span></h2><p><h3>What team is Elijhaa Penny on?</h3><p>Penny played for six NFL seasons before retirement in November 2022.
