The “Just Give Me a Reason” commemorated their marriage in a touching <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post, but she also reflected on how they’ve also been through some hard times. “Love is a lifetime of coming back to the table. We almost didn’t make it to this one, well a couple of them, if I’m being honest,” she began the post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In addition to being the inspiration for Pink — birth name Alecia Beth Moore — and some of her best chart-toppers through their 18 years of marriage, Carey is an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>icon of extreme sports</a> with a trophy collection that rivals his wife’s.

Carey was just 18 when he started on the professional supercross racing circuit and quickly became known for his wild tricks. He was the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first motorcyclist</a> to perform a backflip in competition on his style of bike. Carey also competed in BMX freestyle and currently races off-road trucks. Through his extreme sports career, Carey won 4 X-Games medals.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Carey and his crew at his shop <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hart & Huntington Tattoo</a> & Clothing Company were the subjects of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A&E’s Inked</a>, which premiered in 2005. He was also a cast member on the fifth season of the VH1 reality show The Surreal Life that same year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Additionally, he’s hosted X-Games coverage and MTV2’s Burn Out and appeared in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pink’s music videos</a> “Just Like A Pill”, “So What”, “Raise Your Glass” and “All I Know So Far.” As for the big screen, Carey was the subject of the 2003 biographical documentary Goodtimes With Carey Hart.</p><h2>How Did Carey Meet Pink?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The couple met at the 2001 Summer X-Games, where Carey was a top competitor. Pink said she was initially taken by his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“bad boy charm”</a>. They quickly fell for one another but in 2003 they took a break from their tumultuous relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Pink and Carey reunited in 2005 when Pink was the one to pop the question by holding up a sign that read “Will you marry me?” during one of Carey’s races. “He was never going to ask me because I said no so many times,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>USA Today</a> in 2012.</p><h2>What Was Their Wedding Like?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>The couple was wed during a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relaxed beach ceremony</a> at the Four Seasons in Costa Rica on Jan. 7 2006. The bride wore an edgy Monique Lhuillier design that featured a black bow cascading down the back as she said “I Do” in front of 140 guests, who included Pink’s father and friend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Marie Presley</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“We just love the beach, so we knew we wanted it to be at the beach,” Pink told People in 2006. “We wanted it very fun and nontraditional. We’re spiritual, but we’re not religious. It was about being with our closest friends and family and having a very fun and loose party.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/carey-hart-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed1.jpg><h2>Are Pink and Carey Still Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>The pair separated in Feb. 2008. Pink announced <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the breakup news</a> on her website, writing, “The most important thing for you all to know is that Carey and I love each other so so much. This breakup is not about cheating, anger, or fighting. I know it sounds like cliché bullsh*t, but we are best friends, and we will continue to be.” They reunited 11 months later and in June 2011 the couple <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed daughter Willow</a>. Son Jameson <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>joined the family</a> in Dec. 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Talking about their rough patch with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Redbook</a> in 2013, Pink said they were simply spending too much time apart. “We were working all the time,” she said. “There was so much time between our visits. Carey would see me for five days and be gone for six weeks. We’d try to fix everything in those five days–you just can’t do that. And it builds and builds and you don’t even know what to say or fight about anymore, and there’s no middle ground, and it’s like, f— it, we’re not getting anywhere.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Pink credited couples counseling for keeping the relationship together, in June 2020 telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>, “It’s the only reason that we’re still together because, you know, I think partners after a long time, we just speak — I can’t say it’s a man and woman thing, I think it’s a partner thing, a spouse thing — that you just speak two different languages.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>In her 18th anniversary celebration post, Pink also wrote about how far they’ve come in their love. “When I met you, 22 years ago, I just wanted someone that wouldn’t lie to me,” she wrote. “I didn’t have a clue about commitment, building a life together, intimacy, trust. It’s f**king hard. But man if I’m not humbled by the surprise of loyalty, history, forgiveness, and resilience. How love rearranges itself and reappears after an empty night or five. I’m proud we made it to the other side of this year. I wear our scars proudly. You are my stubborn, beautiful, immovable rock.”</p><h2>Carey’s a Super Dad to His Kids With Pink</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Despite his tough image, Carey loves being a dad. He talked about showing off his softer side in Pink’s 2021 tour documentary, All I Know So Far&nbsp;telling <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>, “I’m kinda glad I got to show a little bit of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>my vulnerable side</a> like being a father. As opposed to—you know—I’m perceived as this wild, crazy, motorcycle, tattooed scumbag so it’s kinda nice for people to see my softer side.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>In her recent anniversary post, Pink also wrote about how she’s so happy their family is still together. “The family we’ve built and the stories we have weaved together and the memories we continue to make are worth more than a thousand million awards that anyone could give me. I love you and I love us,” she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2BipaRlmKrAo63NnWRtbWlqhXV%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jennifer-livingston-bullied-news-anchor-gets-support-from-hollyw.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jennifer Livingston, Bullied News Anchor, Gets Support From Stars (Including Brother Ron)!</a>
