Kennedy is "finding her way through golf," the former <a href=#>NFL</a> superstar said, adding that they golf together.</p><p>Victor only recently fell in love with the game, but he's already "completely addicted" and wants to be the best golfer her can be — and he can achieve that goal with his daughter by his side: "She keeps me motivated to stay in it," Victor told us.

As a matter of fact, the Super Bowl champ told Distractify that his daughter is his mini-me.</p><p>"She tries her little mischievous ways, here and there, tries to get over on certain things," Victor explained. "She's sly and slick. She makes the same face as I do when I'm probably mischievous too. So it's like, 'I know when you're lying [and] I know when you're trying to get something out of one of your parents that you probably shouldn't have.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Victor said his favorite part about being a dad is watching Kennedy grow.</h2><p>While opening up about his daughter, Victor told Distractify that his favorite thing about being a dad is watching his baby girl grow into a competent young woman.</p><p>"I think no two days are alike; every day is a new challenge," he exclusively told us. "Every day is a new thing that they teach you. Every day, they want something new, there's always something that's gonna keep you on your toes. So just that day-to-day vibe of watching them grow and watching them do their thing is pretty cool."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for his 2023 Father's Day plans, Victor revealed he simply wants to "experience it with my daughter."</p><p>"As long as we're together, as long as we're hanging, [it's going to be a great day]," he told Distractify.
