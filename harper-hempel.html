However, her religion is still unknown at the moment.</p><h2>Career And Profession</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Harper was a starter for her high school volleyball team for four years. During her high school volleyball career, the Kentucky Volleyball Coaches Association (KVCA) named Hempel to the All-State for three-time.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, she won the district MVP honors during her senior season and was also voted as the team captain by her teammates three times.</p><p>She also earned the Team Leadership Award 2011 for her exceptional leadership qualities.</p><p>Moreover, Hempel won the Raider Award, given to the student with top performance on and off-court for two straight years.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Harper represented the team Wildcats of the University of Kentucky.

There she takes care of community management and social management services for famous companies like Voodoo Ranger and Halo Top Ice Cream.</p><p>Moreover, Hempel works as a social media marketing manager for All Social Jessie.

Her father, Rich Hempel, is a part of the basketball community, and she has grown up in a family which focuses on the NBA.</p><p>Thus, it makes sense that Hempel fell for someone who plays basketball.</p><p>Murray and Hempel started dating when Jamal was still on the college team, and Hempel was in her sophomore year.</p><p>Both of them were star players on their teams. Hence, it is apparent that they got attracted to each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/harper-hempel-1-820x1024.jpg><p>After the Denver Nuggets drafted Murray in the 2016 Draft, he moved to Denver, leaving Kentucky, whereas Harper continued with her degree at the university.</p><p>Furthermore, the couple stayed in a relationship. Although Murray and Hempel were far away from each other, they reunited after Hempel completed her degree.</p><p>The couple had to continue spending their time apart as Murray left to play in the NBA playoffs.</p><p>Due to the NBA’s restrictions regarding the coronavirus pandemic, Jamal had to stay in his bubble to prevent being exposed to the virus.</p><p>However, Harper celebrated her 24th birthday without her then-boyfriend, Jamal Murray.</p><p>Hempel used to post pictures with Jamal frequently, but after an explicit video went viral, both became very private regarding their matters and stopped sharing their photos of one another on their accounts.</p><p>As of now, they do not share each other’s pictures and do not follow each other on their socials, so we can assume the pair have parted ways.</p><h2>Video Scandal</h2><p>An incident that happened on March 22nd, 2020, got a lot of negative attention towards the couple.</p><p>Reportedly, an explicit scene was uploaded through&nbsp;Jamal Murray’s Instagram. People assumed that the girl in the video clip was Harper Hempel.</p><p>Murray quickly deleted the video, but more than 480,000 followers from the NBA star’s Instagram saw the video. The clip created a lot of headlines all over the internet.</p><p>Murray claimed that someone hacked his Instagram; hence, that is how the story was uploaded.</p><p>The hacker posted four more random stories before posting the explicit clip, which kind of proves his Instagram was actually hacked.</p><p>Moreover, Murray apologized to his fans and informed everyone that somebody else had authority over his account for a moment and was working on the following issue.</p><p>Even after Murray deleted the clip from the story, the clip’s screen recording started circulating on Twitter.</p><p>Hence, Hempel went on to Twitter and pleaded with people to delete the video if they had it.</p><p>After the incident, Harper and Jamal both deactivated their accounts for a while. Because of the clip, both of their reputations got very messy in public.</p><p>Similarly, people also noticed that the couple didn’t even follow the regulations of the lockdown.</p><h2>Social Media Break</h2><p>Because of the unwanted attention attained due to the couple’s intimate clip, Hempel deactivated her account.</p><p>During that time, Hempel had more than ten thousand followers on her Instagram. We can very well contemplate that she didn’t want all the negative attention coming her way.</p><p>She faced the problem for a very long time, and currently, she is active on Instagram and has been posting frequently.</p><p>Moreover, after the incident, Harper switched her Twitter account to private. Later, Twitter suspended her account.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The former volleyball athlete has not revealed much information about herself.
