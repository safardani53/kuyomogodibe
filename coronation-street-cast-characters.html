cobbles.</p><p>He ruffled many feathers and chased his own estranged son Jacob Hay out of Weatherfield after a dodgy deal gone wrong.</p><p>In early 2023, Damon took things to another level when he began an affair with Sarah Platt.</p><p>When her husband Adam Barlow found out, Damon feared for his life and escaped the cobbles as the solicitor recruited another criminal called Niall to help him get rid of Damon.</p><p>During his time away, Sarah Platt found out she was pregnant with Damon's baby but it all ended in devastation when she miscarried.</p><p>Now, Damon is back and found himself embroiled in a plot to kidnap and kill Adam.</p><p>However, he could not go through with it and instead confessed his desire to live a purer life with Sarah by his side.</p><p>But his brother Harvey

returned</h2><p>Damon's brother Harvey Gaskell has also made an explosive comeback.</p><p>The gangster tormented many Weatherfield residents, including Leanne Battersby, whom he tried to murder.</p><p>Regular viewers will recall that Harvey accidentally killed off Sam Blakeman's mother and he was eventually thrown in prison for his crimes.</p><p>In recent Corrie scenes, Harvey received letters from Sam who was looking for answers for his mother's death.</p><p>Harvey was last seen as he handed a whopping amount of money to a struggling Nick Tilsley, unbeknownst to anybody in Coronation Street.</p><p>Nick was hopeful that, due to Harvey being in prison, their agreement would remain under wraps.</p><p>However, actor <a href=#>Will Mellor</a> will be reprising his role as the treacherous Harvey Gaskell, meaning trouble is definitely ahead for Nick but also his other half, Leanne Battersby.</p><p>He has a robbery on his mind and has enlisted Damon to help him with it.</p><p>But just what trouble will the brothers find themselves in?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ryan Connor - left</h2><img

alongside girlfriend Crystal.</p><p>The character, played by actor Ryan Prescott, decided to make the move to Glasgow alongside his girlfriend after a rocky few months following his horror acid attack and his romantic woes with Daisy.</p><p>However, the door has been left open with Coronation Street making no official announcement of his exit giving huge hopes that he will be back in 2024.</p><p>Ryan became an OnlyFans model during his latest few months on the show.</p><p>He began stripping off and performing explicit acts on video as well as taking part in x-rated live streams in order to drum up cash to fund his steroid addiction.</p><p>Ryan was compelled to turn to the adult platform after he opted to stay indoors following his acid attack and not take his old job back of being a waiter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

returning</h2><p>As her son Paul continues to struggle with motor neurone disease, Bernie Winter has faced her own turmoil after being sent to prison.</p><p>ITV viewers will recall that Bernie was involved in the late Shelly Rossington's online scam and she was recently arrested for handling stolen goods.</p><p>Bernie sadly missed out on her son's last Christmas celebrations having been sent down to her role in the crime just a week before the festive period.</p><p>So far, Bernie has been off-screen for a number of weeks as a result of her prison stint but it is unlilely to be the last fans have seen of her.</p><p>Actress Jane Hazlegrove is expected to return to the cobbles once the storyline has played out.</p><p>Viewers can expect to see her once again in just a number of weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

left</h2><p>After more than two decades on our screens, Peter Barlow star Chris Gascoyne has left the show - and this time it seems to be for good.</p><p>Despite his departure the door has been left open for his return.</p><p>Earlier this year, Chris was cast in a stage production of Peter Pan as Captain Hook, a role he will be playing at the Alban Arena during the Christmas and New Year period.</p><p>On-screen, tension built up for Peter as he became involved in Stephen Reid's serial killer storyline by selling off one of Rufus Donahue's belongings following his murder.</p><p>However, his life has changed for good after he was held responsible for the death of Stephen Reid after he ran him over and killed him.</p><p>It shook his world as he had to come to terms with his actions even though the police had dropped any case against him.</p><p>Despite this, Peter began to struggle with life and in order to set him free, Carla encouraged him to take off and set sail with his old plas who had been begiing for him to join their crew aboard a ship.</p><p>Realising that it was Peter's only chance of happiness, Carla booked a one-way ticket for her husband.</p><p>Having agreed to go, Peter backed his bags on Christmas Day and headed off on Boxing Day morning, seemingly ending his marriage to Carla in the process.</p><p>Carla later confirmed to Roy that they had called it "a day" in order for him to live his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

left</h2><p>Ryan Connor got a huge surprise as Crystal Hyde returned to Corrie.</p><p>Actress Erin Austen was last seen in the Street in early 2023, following Ryan's acid attack.</p><p>Crystal made her debut in the show in March, 2023, flirting with Ryan and promising him a new job opportunity as a DJ in Ibiza.</p><p>But when she learned he had been badly disfigured during his acid attack, she wiped her hands clean of him and left the cobbles.</p><p>Daisy Midgeley was in charge of letting Ryan know what had happened but, as fans will remember, she impersonated Crystal to cheer him up.</p><p>Crystal was last heard of when Ryan found out she was comatose after a horrific accident, prompting him to realise he had been catfished.</p><p>Since then, Ryan forgave Daisy Midgeley and the pair allowed their romantic feelings to take over as they dragged each other to bed, despite her engagement to Daniel Osbourne.</p><p>However, despite her brief return, Crystal made a low-key exit alongside Ryan when they both decided to move to Glasgow in the hopes of having happy new life together with each other.</p><img

leaving</h2><p>Paul will be killed off later this year after the&nbsp;character is diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND).</p><p>MND is a fatal, rapidly progressing disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, attacking the nerves that control movement so muscles no longer work, often impacting the patient's senses such as sight, sound and feeling.</p><p>The soap is working closely the <a href=#>MND Association</a> on this storyline and will explore the impact of the diagnosis on Paul and his loved ones as his condition progresses.</p><p>Actor Peter Ash said: "Paul is completely blindsided by the diagnosis and he decides to keep it from his family and friends as he tries to come to terms with the news.</p><p>"I knew very little about MND before embarking on the storyline and I am hugely grateful to the MND Association for all their help and support.</p><p>"For any actor playing a role which examines a real life issue or condition there comes a huge sense of responsibility and we are aware that some people watching this storyline are experiencing it in reality, it is their life.</p><p>"Awareness and education are really important. I have learned so much even in the short time I have been involved in this storyline. We hope Paul’s journey can make people more aware of the symptoms and what it is like for someone to live with MND."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/steal-keys-throw-party-picture-851881449-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mason Radcliffe (Luca Toolan) - joined</h2><p>Dylan Wilson has made a controversial friend in the Street as part of a bullying storyline.</p><p>Luca Toolan joined Coronation Street in September, 2023, taking on the role of Mason Radcliffe, and was introduced to viewers as Ruby Dobbs' bully.</p><p>After tormenting her alone, he recruited several others to help him bully her more.</p><p>In more recent scenes of the show, Mason caught the attention of Dylan and Liam Connor when the three of them skipped school together.</p><p>When he pressured them to smoke from a vape pen, Dylan felt sick but Liam had a severe asthma attack.</p><p>Mason ran off, leaving Dylan to call an ambulance for his pal.</p><p>Since then, Mason and his gang have been targeting Liam Connor with viewers predicting a tragic twist in the lad's bullying storyline.</p><p>Mason's bad behaviour is set to continue but what other sort of havoc will he wreak throughout the cobbles?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jack-carroll-coronation-street-854235042-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bobby (Jack Carroll) - joined</h2><p>Britain's Got Talent star Jack Carroll will be joining the program in upcoming months as the estranged son of Rob Donovan, Bobby.</p><p>According to Corrie boss Iain MacLeod, the new character will be at the core of some drama-packed scenes in Corrie as he will show up out of the blue shortly after Christmas.</p><p>Bobby's father Rob is serving a life sentence in prison for the murder of popular resident Tina McIntyre.</p><p>So far, Bobby has done nothing but ruffle feathers with Carla and appears to be more causing trouble than he is worth with the character.</p><p>Bobby is currently living with his aunty following Peter's departure but it seems Carla has been regretting her decision to allow him to stay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itv-com-photographer-danielle-baguley-714279992-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dean Turnbull (Anthony Crank) - returning</h2><p>Anthony Crank joined the Corrie line-up in early March, 2022, as Abi Webster's old friend and dealer, Dean Turnbull.</p><p>Abi spiralled out of control following her separation from Kevin Webster and Dean supplied her with drugs.</p><p>But she got her act back together following the <a href=#>surprise birth of her son Alfie.</a></p><p>Dean reappeared in the cobbles in the late summer of 2023 when Cassandra Plummer came back herself to Weatherfield with her mother Evelyn, after trying to get clean.</p><p>An explosive altercation broke out as Dean confronted Cassie over her dues to him and Michael Bailey intervened.</p><p>But viewers haven't seen the last of Dean Turnbull.</p><p>A source recently told The Sun: "The cobbles are going to be rocked by the return of nasty drug dealer Dean Turnbull."</p><p>"He's terrorised Abi Webster and Cassie Plummer before now and he's back to his old tricks.</p><p>"Fans will see him team up with another returning villain as he's wrapped up in Damon Hay's comeback and his war against his brother Harvey."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/go-leave-nina-picks-award-656710251-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tommy Orpington (Matt Milburn) - returning</h2><p>Fans will undoubtedly be shocked to see Matt Milburn come back to Coronation Street as former Weatherfield County FC footballer Tommy Orpington.</p><p>When he first appeared in the cobbles, Tommy sought the help of Michelle Connor to organise his wedding.</p><p>His successful football career was halted after an accident in the Street and he was struck off from work for six months.</p><p>Tommy retired from playing in June, 2021, thus allowing James Bailey to be promoted to the number 9 in his place.</p><p>Soap bosses have decided to bring Tommy back as he's set to be involved in a new romance storyline with an established female character.</p><p>Who will it be?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itv-com-photograph-c-itv-856330133-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Linda Hancock (Jacqueline Leonard) - returning</h2><p>Joseph Brown will be reunited with his grandmother Linda in upcoming weeks.</p><p>Actress Jacqueline Leonard, who took on the role of Linda Hancock for the first time in 2015, will <a href=#>make a full-time return</a> to the show as Joseph struggles.</p><p>But could she take him away from his father Chesney Brown?</p><p>"Joseph’s issues, which are on screen as we speak, culminate in him falling behind slightly at school", Iain MacLeod explained.</p><p>"Then Joseph’s fairy godmother turns up in the shape of Linda, his grandmother."</p><p>"She, as is her want, rides in and decides that she’s going to try and fix all this and starts throwing money at the situation, which puts&nbsp;Chesney&nbsp;and Gemma in this impossible quandary which is they feel that by accepting financial help from Linda, they’re seeding control of Joseph’s life a bit."</p><p>Conflict is definitely on the horizon as Chesney and Gemma Winter, Joseph's stepmother, will find it hard to see Linda throw her money around to help.</p><p>"They feel instinctively, ‘This our son and we should be making these decisions and it doesn’t feel right that Linda is wading in with her chequebook and saving the day.’&nbsp;"</p><p>"But on the other side of it, they have to prioritise what’s right for Joseph, who is actually having a hard time and could do with the support. It’s a lot of fun in places, but we were trying to tell a very realistic story about family dynamics."</p><p>How will it play out?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tv-legend-ram-john-holder-848714826.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sarge Bailey (Ram John Holder)</strong> - left</h2><p>The Bailey family are set for turmoil as Ed's financial struggles continue.</p><p>But could one member of the large family bring some form of relief?</p><p>Former Desmond star Ram John Holder has been added to the show's line-up and he is due to be another prominent character in the cobbles.</p><p>The 89-year-old finally rocked up the cobbles as Sarge Bailey, who is none other than Ed and Ronnie's father.</p><p>"Ram has already been filming his scenes in Weatherfield, though viewers won’t get to see them for some months", the source claimed.</p><p>"It’s a substantial role for him to have been cast in, though it will come as second nature [as] he’s a seasoned star of multiple dramas - including soaps."</p><p>However, he has since left the cobbles for good after Ed's explosive gambling habit was uncovered.</p><p>He has made his way back home after his fleeting stint but could he come back one day?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/c-itv-plc-reproduced-editorial-513083629.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon)</strong> - returned</h2><p>Bethany Platt has made a triumphant return to the Corrie cobbles.</p><p>Actress <a href=#>Lucy Fallon</a> has reprised her role after three years of absence and left the show when her character moved away to London for a new career opportunity.</p><p>Her exit left a grieving Daniel Osbourne heartbroken but he has since moved on with Rovers barmaid Daisy Midgeley.</p><p>Lucy Fallon herself teased trouble ahead for the couple while speaking to The Sun in September.</p><p>"I'm interested to see what they'll do with&nbsp;Daniel,&nbsp;Daisy&nbsp;and Bethany.
