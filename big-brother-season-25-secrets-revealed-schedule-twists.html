Brother</a> will premiere on August 2.</p><p>The 90-minute episode will air at 8pm.</p><p><a href=#>Big Brother</a> is a reality competition show where 10 to 18 houseguests participate in numerous competitions for around 90 days, to make it to the end and win $750,000.</p><p><a href=#>Last year's winner</a>, Taylor Hale, made history as the first Black woman to win the regular US season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON BIG BROTHER">READ MORE ON BIG BROTHER</h2><p>Tamar Braxton became the first Black woman ever to win a season in the US, as she took home the prize money on Season Two of <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a>.</p><p>Despite the season being delayed, there have been many things that were revealed about Season 25 already.</p><p>But, just because some facts have been revealed, it is always expected of Big Brother fans and players to Expect the Unexpected.</p><p>Find out what's in store as the houseguests gear up for a season of love, backstabbing, twists, greed, and more.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>THE HOST</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/00-9-00-pm-et-763559069.jpg><p><a href=#>Julie Chen Moonves,</a> who has been the host since season one will return for Big Brother's iconic 25th season.</p><p>She revealed that <a href=#>Meredith Viera</a> was <a href=# aria-label="originally considered for the role (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally considered for the role</a>, before CBS picked her.</p><p>Julie has gone through marriage, pregnancies, fears of being fired, and more, while on the show.</p><p>The 53-year-old has been the one constant throughout the <a href=#>24 years</a> Big Brother has been on.</p><p>The host recently opened up to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;earlier this month about whether or not she sees herself continuing with the show for future seasons.</p><p>The outlet asked Julie what would make her <a href=#>consider stepping down</a> and she listed a few reasons.</p><p>"I look at my joints. I look at, 'how do my hips and my knees feel this morning?'" she laughed.</p><p>"I like to take one season at a time. Going into Season 25, I'm like, 'I never want it to end."</p><p>Julie continued: "I think there would have to be a few things [to make me step away], like if I feel like the public is getting tired of me or the show is not what I want it to be.</p><p>"But with [executive producers] Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan leading the way, I can't imagine it ever being something that I feel is not in alignment with me or what the show should be in my mind."</p><p>EW said that when the time comes for the 53-year-old to step down, it will be a feeling, for her and the show as a whole.</p><p>"I think you know when it's time to go, whether as a show or me as a host, and I just don't see signs of that right now. But you just never know," she said.</p><h2>SCHEDULE CHANGE</h2><p>Big Brother has gone through many schedule changes throughout the years.</p><p>When the first season aired, the show was on every night of the week.</p><p>Once it was revamped, it moved to three nights a week with live feeds running 24/7.</p><p>Sometimes it was a combination of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday, and sometimes Saturdays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000834270813.jpg><p>But, in most recent years, Big Brother has aired on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.</p><p>However, this is <a aria-label="scheduled to change (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to change</a> for Season 25.</p><p>Due to the reality show airing in late Summer, Big Brother will start out at 8pm on Wednesdays and Sundays and 9pm on Thursdays.</p><p>However, once September hits, the fall schedule is starting back up, and that pushes Big Brother down the totem pole.</p><p>The CBS show will then air on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm.</p><p>And for nominations shows, fans will have to tune in at 10pm on Sundays.</p><p>This is due to the scheduled fall shows and <a href=#>NFL</a> games.</p><p>Before Sunday episodes, CBS will air reruns of <a href=#>Yellowstone</a>.</p><p>The number will depend on how many football games are airing that day.</p><p>For those who cannot stay up that late, Big Brother will show live feeds on CBS All Access and Paramount+.</p><p>The episodes can also be watched the next day on <a href=#>Paramount+</a>.</p><h2>THE THEME</h2><p>Each season, Big Brother has a theme.</p><p>Whether it's Heroes vs. Villains, Exes, Twins, returning houseguests, or something simply as the beach, or space, the theme always follows throughout the whole season.</p><p>While the theme for Season 25 has not been confirmed, Julie did drop some hints on Instagram as to what it could be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/www-instagram-com-p-cvf1kferl2v-834271615.jpg><p>"Do you see what I see. So excited to reveal this&nbsp;#BB25&nbsp;key art for you all. But we had to wait until the Houseguests were sequestered because there's many clues to this season's theme. Can you guess?" she captioned the <a aria-label="post (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p><p>Julie stood in front of the Big Brother symbol, which looked to be written in sand.</p><p>Behind tha were different colors and shapes, hinting at this year's theme.</p><p>The green symbol almost resembles a monster hand, which could allude to a horror theme, since the houseguests will be there close to Halloween.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/cbs-television-network-available-stream-708929316.jpg><p>Other fans on Reddit thought the other pictures would be a comic book theme, or superheroes.</p><p>Another fan thought that the horror and comic book pictures could be hinting at a TV genres theme.</p><p>A Reddit user thought those things might add up to a Hollywood theme.</p><p>Many others thought it might be a "multi-verse" theme, which would be bringing back aspects from old seasons into the new one.</p><h2>CAST REVEAL</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/12-new-houseguests-4-returning-834275799.jpg><p>Big Brother typically reveals the cast of the new season before it starts.</p><p>No cast has been released to the public yet, but there's rumors that it could be coming soon.</p><p>Entertainment Weekly's Mike Bloom revealed on a <a href=# aria-label="podcast (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast </a>last week that the cast bios and reveal will most likely come on July 31.</p><p>"Big Brother 25 is coming, and so is my coverage. I can tease that I do have some pre-season stuff coming out, Big Brother-wise: some teases, some previews that happen over the course of the next couple of weeks," he said.</p><p>"Though again, I will caution, if people are waiting for a cast drop, and you have some social obligations that last week and weekend of July, I think you're fine to keep that in your calendar, just sayin'!"</p><p>He ended: "You should be okay. Maybe the work week will have a fun start to it? I'll just say that."</p><h2>NEW HOUSEGUESTS</h2><p>It does not appear that any returning houseguests will be part of the competition this season.</p><p>According to a press release from <a aria-label="Paramount Press Express (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Press Express</a>, In a special 90-minute episode, Big Brother premieres its milestone 25th&nbsp;season as a group of all-new Houseguests moves into the Big Brother House."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/00-pm-et-pt-cbs-834275813.jpg><p>"Expect the unexpected this summer with a season full of twists and turns and throwbacks to the last 24 seasons."</p><p>This pattern has been consistent with the two seasons as well.</p><p>Big Brother has hosted two complete All-Stars seasons, and others where only a few returning houseguests came back.</p><p>The last All-Stars season was Season 22, in 2020, due to COVID-19.</p><p>Despite this being a milestone season, it would be shocking for them to bring returning houseguests back so soon.</p><p>Season 16 runner-up, Cody Calafiore, took home the win on the last All-Stars season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But, with the show airing its 25th season, Big Brother alum are sure to make appearances for competitions and special moments.</p><p>To find out the other twists and themes for this season, tune in to Season 25 on August 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/julie-chen-moonves-hosts-live-834275802.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/big-brother-fans-slam-show-600265894.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/julie-chen-moonves-introduces-big-831773551-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZm6Adn%2BQaJmin12Xv7DAx56pZquVlsCwuoxrbGarlZi%2FpsDSZqmerpWWuaawjKyaoZ2UqrmmedOwoKyso2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bill-murrays-girlfriend-list.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bill Murrays Girlfriend: Who is Bill Murray Dating?</a>
