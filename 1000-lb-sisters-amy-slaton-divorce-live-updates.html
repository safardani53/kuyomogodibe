Sisters </a>star <a href=#>Amy</a>, 35, and <a href=#>Michael</a>, 40, sat on opposite sides of the <a href=#>Kentucky</a> courtroom today before the judge called on the former couple.</p><p>The ex-couple <a href=#>split up in February</a> after four years of marriage and filed for divorce soon after. According to court documents,&nbsp;Amy filed an <a href=#>emergency protective order</a> on February 28 - just four days after making a&nbsp;<a href=#>911 call</a>&nbsp;claiming&nbsp;Michael had become "violent" in their home.</p><p>In a shocking move today, Amy <a href=#>dropped</a> her <a href=#>domestic violence charges</a> against Michael. In lieu of the charges, a civil restraining order will be filed separately on the divorce case.</p><p>Michael and Amy are now only allowed contact via text to discuss the children and their shared parenting schedule as they were granted <a href=#>temporary joint custody</a> - though Michael argued for permanent joint custody of&nbsp;<a href=#>Gage</a>, 2,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Glenn</a>, 10 months.</p><p>Despite Michael's wishes, Amy dismissed this motion because of her concerns that their kids need more consistency in their schedule and worries that Michael's mom wouldn't be able to assist with childcare.</p><p>The judge did not reach a full decision on the custody battle and is expected to issue it in writing. The next hearing for Amy and Michael's divorce is scheduled for June 1.</p><p><strong>Read our Amy Slaton divorce blog for the latest updates...</strong></p><ul class=liveblog-entries><li id=liveblog-entry-8043467 class="post-8043467 live_blog_entry type-live_blog_entry status-publish hentry category-uncategorized liveblog-entry-class-8043467 liveblog-entry" data-timestamp=1683295200 readability=45.031847133758><h3 class=wp-block-heading>More on season five</h3><p>Season four of 1000-lb sisters aired on&nbsp;<a href=#>TLC</a>&nbsp;on March 21.</p><p>The season followed&nbsp;<a href=#>Tammy’s</a>&nbsp;love story with&nbsp;<a href=#>Caleb Willingham,</a>&nbsp;leading to their wedding during the finale.</p><p><a href=#>Amy’s</a>&nbsp;pregnancy journey was also documented in the last season of the show.</p><p>The network has not released further information on the next season but The US Sun exclusively revealed a camera crew was present at Amy’s divorce hearing yesterday.</p></li><li id=liveblog-entry-8043466 class="post-8043466 live_blog_entry type-live_blog_entry status-publish hentry category-uncategorized liveblog-entry-class-8043466 liveblog-entry" data-timestamp=1683293400 readability=49.108066971081><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Amy and Tammy’s salaries, continued</h3><p>A Slaton family insider&nbsp;<a href=#>previously revealed</a>&nbsp;to The US Sun that&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy</a>&nbsp;makes the most on the show because both of her sons&nbsp;<a href=#>Gage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Glenn</a>&nbsp;have contracts.</p><p>Although according to the source, the kids’ cash isn’t going into Amy’s pocket: she has the funds set up in trusts to go toward her boys’ college tuition.</p><p>On top of the small salaries, the family also feels producers aren’t telling their story truthfully.</p><p>The insider close to the&nbsp;<a href=#>TLC</a>&nbsp;stars claims every time a cast member attempts to have a “serious conversation” on the show, the producers edit it out.</p></li><li id=liveblog-entry-8043462 class="post-8043462 live_blog_entry type-live_blog_entry status-publish hentry category-uncategorized liveblog-entry-class-8043462 liveblog-entry" data-timestamp=1683291600 readability=51.605063291139><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Amy and Tammy’s salaries</h3><p>The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed the cast of&nbsp;<a href=#>1,000-Lb Sisters</a>&nbsp;– including Tammy and&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Slaton</a>, their half-brother Chris Combs, and half-sister Amanda – feel they could be making more money if they left their current production network’s contract.</p><p><a href=#>Tammy</a>&nbsp;takes up most of the screen time in recent seasons, and a source close to the Slaton family has shared she only makes around $2-3K per episode.</p><p>The insider also confirmed Tammy spent all of her earnings from the show paying for her 14 months of weight rehab without financial support from the producers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tammy’s half-sister Amanda – who joined the cast during season three – only takes in about $700 a month for her appearances on the show.</p></li></ul><ul class=liveblog-entries><li id=liveblog-entry-8043456 class="post-8043456 live_blog_entry type-live_blog_entry status-publish hentry category-uncategorized liveblog-entry-class-8043456 liveblog-entry" data-timestamp=1683289800 readability=48.985915492958><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How much weight has Tammy Slaton lost, continued</h3><p>On January 20, 2023, Tammy posted a video to the&nbsp;<a href=#>social media</a>&nbsp;app that has garnered nearly 690K views and more than 37K likes.</p><p>In the clip, the reality star shared multiple images of herself that show her weight loss, which came after she revealed in the season four premiere of 1000-lb Sisters that she had previously weighed 717 lbs.</p><p>Season four will continue to give viewers insight into Tammy’s difficult journey.
