boys is volunteering for a prestigious children’s cricket organisation and has previously slept in the same building as youngsters whilst on tour.</p><p>Wasim Aslam, the London Schools Cricket Association fixtures secretary, is now at the centre of an investigation by the England and Wales Cricket Board after it was revealed he is on the Sex Offender’s Register and is banned from working with children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000275152639-e1476668022503.jpg><p>Aslam, whose surname used to be Majid, was jailed in 2004 for two counts of indecency and three of indecent assault. The 40-year-old also groomed two vulnerable 15-year-old boys and embarked on a “carefully calculated and planned campaign” to abuse them.</p><p>Parents were horrified to learn of Aslam’s disgusting past – especially after it was revealed he has been in the role since 2012, sleeping in the same building as children at cricket festivals.</p><p>They have since called for him to be sacked, although his role does not involve direct contact with players.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>A source close to the LSCA said: “Parents are horrified and furious. They can’t believe a paedophile has been involved with LSCA all this time and they knew nothing of it. Parents have seen him at matches on school grounds by himself in a golf buggy. They are sick with worry.”</p><p>LSCA chair Richard Balmforth said Aslam was being watched at all times when he was in the buggy and insisted he did not have any direct contact with children.</p><p>He also said that when on tours Aslam slept in an adult-only annexe with a chaperone in his room.</p><p>He added: “We took advice from the ECB. They told us our arrangements were perfectly OK.”</p><p>Speaking at home in South East London, where he is an estate agent, Aslam said: “I work with adults, I don’t have any direct contact or involvement with children and I don’t have their contact details.”</p><p>Asked if the police knew of his position at LSCA, he replied: “Er, yes I believe so.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000275174300.jpg><p>Majid was jailed for four years on January 5 2004 for grooming two pupils at the school he used to work in as a history teacher.</p><p>He was told in Northampton Crown Court that he was a “predatory figure” after it was revealed he sent the pair up to 1,500 lewd text messages after helping one of the boys sort out a bullying problem at school.</p><p>Judge Charles Wide QC said at the time: "You embarked on a carefully calculated and planned campaign to abuse two young and vulnerable 15-year-old boys.</p><p>"You were deliberately and calculatedly using your position to abuse children in your charge.</p><p>"You deliberately and calculatedly abused trust placed in you by pupils and staff. Entirely for your sexual gratification you singled out two boys.</p><p>"They were both in different ways vulnerable. They had both just arrived at the school and weren't part of an established network of friends.</p><p>"Both of them were having difficulties in relation to their sexuality and you locked on to that and you did that in order to become part of their personal lives and develop relationships with them.</p><p>"You have made already difficult lives more difficult. You were devious and manipulative simply to serve your own selfish ends which had to do with your sexual gratification.</p><p>"You groomed them relentlessly. You created the opportunities for abuse."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000275173423.jpg><p>Aslam used to coach at the LSCA before the trial, but left before being taken on again in an admin role in 2012.</p><p>Harry Fletcher, director of Voice 4 Victims, said: “The rights of victims must be paramount in all cases of sexual abuse. There needs to be an urgent investigation.”</p><p>The voluntary LSCA runs eight teams aged under-10 to under-17, with training sessions at the iconic Lord’s cricket ground in London. It is where ex-England captains Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting used to play.</p><p>An ECB spokesman confirmed a probe, adding: “We have made clear to the club that the individual must not undertake any role which involves contact with children.”</p><p>The Metropolitan Police said: “We take failures to comply with terms of the Sex Offenders’ Register seriously and will follow up information that suggests a potential breach.”</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
