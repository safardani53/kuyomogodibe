an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Saturday Night Live</a> alum said his budding film career

For some reason, people in movies, they don't have them that much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months later, the comedian gave an update to PEOPLE about how the removal process was going. "I get my next treatment [in] like a month or so. They said by the time I'm 30, they should all be gone. So they got like two more years left of this," he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Davidson has gotten a few more tattoos since his big announcement (most notably, several for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ex-girlfriend Kim Kardashian</a>), he has started removing some of his other ink, including some smaller tattoos on his hands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2023, Davidson was photographed shirtless while hitting the beach with his rumored new love interest <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chase Sui Wonders</a>. In the photos, several of the comedian's tats appear to have been removed — including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>all of the ones he had dedicated to Kardashian</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steven Ferdman/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From his tattoos dedicated to his former relationships to his sillier, lighthearted designs, here's a complete guide to all of <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pete Davidson</a>'s tattoos, past and present.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-swerve-life></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>"Swerve Life"</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bobby Bank/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Davidson's first tattoo</a>, the words "Swerve Life" written on his leg, was inspired by rapper Big Sean's song "Mercy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was 17 when I got my first tattoo.

In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the comedian confirmed that the tattoo was real, saying: "He actually killed it," and adding that the letter "Z" had to be made thicker because Kelly retraced it "when they were starting to roll camera."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-babies></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>"We Babies"</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bobby Bank/GC Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Davidson and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Miley Cyrus</a> got matching tattoos saying "WE BABIES" to commemorate their SNL sketch in which they were dressed like "trap babies." While appearing on a 2021 episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>, Davidson said he had his tattoo artist come to 30 Rock to tattoo himself and Cyrus.
