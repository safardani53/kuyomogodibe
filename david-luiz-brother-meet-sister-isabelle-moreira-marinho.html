That’s why many think David has a brother.</p><p>Isabella, the eldest of two siblings, maybe into a different profession than soccer but has immense support for her brother’s passion.</p><p>A supportive & mentor sister, she is also an entrepreneur & a doting mother of two with her high school sweetheart husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/David-Luiz-And-His-Sister-Isabelle-Marinho.jpg><p>And as for her soccer star brother <a href=#>David Luiz</a>, trademarked for his curly hair & skillful footwork, he barely needs an introduction.</p><p>The 36-year-old player currently plays for Flamengo, a Brazilian football club, following his transfer from Arsenal, where he played from 2019 to 2021.</p><p>Having started his soccer career at Esporte Clube Vitória in 2006, David went on to play for various clubs across the globe: Benfica (of the Portuguese league), Chelsea (of the Premier League) & Paris Saint-Germain (of the Ligue 1).</p><p>While in Chelsea, Luiz won a UEFA Champions League (2012) & UEFA Europa League two times (2013 & 2019).</p><p>Moreover, the center-back has represented the Brazilian national football team in the 2014 FIFA World Cup & Copa America (2011 & 2015).</p><h2>Meet David Luiz’s Sister: Isabelle Moreira Marinho</h2><p>Luiz and his elder sister Isabelle Moreira Marinho were born to Regina Celia Moreira & Ladislau Marinho. Both of them are former teachers.</p><p>Isabelle was born on June 24, 1983, while her younger brother was born on April 22, 1987. The two siblings have an age gap of three years, nine months & 29 days.</p><p>According to her Instagram bio, she runs an online clothing store, LaBelle Vestiti, which primarily focuses on women’s wear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Isabelle-Moreira-Marinho-Shared-Picture-With-Her-Brother-David-On-The-Occasion-Of-His-Birthday.jpg><p>There is no denying her own family obligations & business keep her occupied, but it can’t limit her adoration for her brother.</p><p>Isabelle often mentions her soccer player brother David Luiz on her Instagram posts. Not to mention, she attends his games & cheers him from the stands.</p><h3>Married & Mother Of Two</h3><p>Mrs. Marinho leads a happy family of four with her high school sweetheart-turned-husband, Leandro Rafael. Her beau Leandro is also a teacher like her parents.</p><p>The two began dating in 1999 during their teenage & often share throwbacks on their Instagram.</p><p>For instance, on September 4, 2017, Leandro tagged his wife, Isabelle <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrating 18 years of their relationship</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Isabelle-With-Her-Husband-Leandro-Rafael.jpg><p>Around her mid-20s in 2007, Isabelle and Leandro Rafael got married, but they rarely post pictures from their wedding.</p><p>They wished each other their 13th wedding anniversary on March 17, 2020.</p><p>Together, the duo are now parents of two sons but have kept details regarding their identity low-key.</p><h2>Who Are His Parents?</h2><p>David Luiz’s parents: Regina (b. January 1962) & Ladislau, who were both teachers, always respected their kids’ passion.</p><p>Even though they were going through financial struggles, they would do everything their parents would to ensure Luiz gets to play soccer.</p><p>In an interview, his father, Ladislau, told that they were not able to afford David’s soccer cleats. Also, when their soccer prodigy son went to the Salvador-based club Vitória, they paid for the flight tickets in installments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/David-Luizs-Parents.jpg><p>Now upon seeing Luiz as an aspiring soccer figure himself, his parents are more than proud!</p><p>The Brazilian soccer player’s parents are together for more than four decades. They married in December 1980 & are together ever since.</p><p>Needless to say, they are not only his supporters but also his protectors.</p><p>In 2015, when David Luiz was criticized for his poor performance as PSG lost to Barcelona by 3-1 in the Champions League quarter-final, his mom <a href=# rel=noopener>came to his defense</a> & gave him moral support.</p><h2>Does David Luiz Have A Brother?</h2><p>David does not have a brother, but he had a strong brotherly relationship with one of his childhood best friends, Thiago Silva.</p><p>On his side, Silva has two siblings: a brother <a href=#>Erivelton Emiliano da Silva</a> & a sister named Danila.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that David’s father was once an amateur soccer player.</p><p>Ladislau’s support and influence encouraged David and Thiago to take an interest in soccer. David’s father got both of them into their respective young professions by using his contacts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/david-and-thiago.jpg><p>Together, they used to serve as the Brazil national team’s mascots.</p><p>Although Neymar may be the face of Brazil’s World Cup campaign, there is no doubt that the defensive connection between Luiz and Silva is the backbone of Selecao’s success.</p><p>David Luiz and Thiago Silva were a formidable pair during games because of their excellent communication skills.</p><p>Brazil had an 83.33 percent winning record under Scolari when Luiz and Silva started together.</p><p>They have teamed up 12 times in his 20 appearances, recording 10 victories (nine of which were against World Cup-bound opponents), two draws, and one loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwwK%2BgnWWcqra7ecGrpq2glad6rrHErWSsoaOpsrN5yKyYm52cobJuuc6rnKKqkWK6or7Ip5%2BoZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kent-mccloughan.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fame | Kent McCloughan net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a>
