rose to fame in the 1970s, thanks to hit songs like "Rock and Roll All Nite" and "Black Diamond," and built a dedicated fanbase that has remained loyal through the decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The group was co-founded by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gene Simmons</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Paul Stanley</a> in 1973 in New York City. Ace Frehley and Peter Criss joined the band shortly after as the other two original members, but both departed by the early 1980s. All four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The band currently includes Simmons, Stanley, Eric Singer, who joined the band in 1991, and Tommy Thayer, who became a member in 2002. Past KISS members include Eric Carr (drums), Vinnie Vincent (guitar), Mark St. John (guitar) and Bruce Kulick (guitar).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their music, the group is also known for their signature onstage makeup designs. Each look represents a different persona: the "Demon" (Simmons), the "Starchild" (Stanley), the "Catman" (Singer) and the "Spaceman" (Thayer). In 1983, the band ditched their costumes and makeup during what became known as KISS' "unmasked" era. It lasted for over a decade before the group's original lineup reunited briefly in 1996, bringing their iconic personas back along with them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2018, the group <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>announced their farewell tour</a>, revealing that they planned to retire from touring after the final concerts.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>KISS.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All that we have built and all that we have conquered over the past four decades could never have happened without the millions of people worldwide who've filled clubs, arenas and stadiums over those years," KISS said at the time. "This will be the ultimate celebration for those who've seen us and a last chance for those who haven't."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The End of the Road Tour began in 2019, but was put on pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will conclude in December 2023 with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>their "final shows ever"</a> at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The band has expressed that after their final touring shows together, they may still be open to a future Las Vegas residency or one-off concerts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look into the lives of the members of KISS, then and now.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gene-simmons-73></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gene Simmons, 73</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Gene Simmons.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Paul Natkin/Getty ; Gilbert Carrasquillo/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gene Simmons</a>, né Chaim Witz, was born in Israel on Aug. 25, 1949. He immigrated to New York City at age 8 with his mother and changed his name to Gene Klein, taking on his mother's maiden name. For <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>his stage name</a>, the band's co-lead singer and bassist took inspiration from rockabilly singer Jumpin' Gene Simmons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simmons was in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>his first band</a>, The Lynx, as a teenager. In 1968, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>he joined</a> Bullfrog Bheer, and later formed the group Wicked Lester with Paul Stanley. The duo ended up walking away from the group and a record deal to create KISS. Outside of music, Simmons worked as a sixth-grade teacher in New York for six months and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>was the assistant</a> to a Vogue editor in 1973.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simmons has remained KISS' bassist and co-lead singer since the group's inception. His persona, the "Demon," is infamous for sticking out his tongue, vomiting fake blood and even spitting fire on stage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the band, Simmons has launched several other successful ventures, including a magazine, record label and an animated show, My Dad the Rock Star.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rocker is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>father of two children</a>, daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sophie</a> and son Nick Simmons, whom he shares with his wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Shannon Tweed-Simmons</a>. The couple has been together since 1983, but waited 28 years to officially tie the knot in 2011. His family life was chronicled on Gene Simmons Family Jewels, his reality series that ran on A&E from 2006 to 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simmons prefers to keep his personal circle small, telling Goldmine magazine that outside of his bandmate Stanley, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he doesn't have friends</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even today as I sit here, other than Paul [Stanley], and we only get together when we do stuff for the band … How do I say this without sounding inhuman? I don't have friends," he told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April 2023, Simmons made headlines after he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>became ill at a KISS concert in Brazil</a> and needed to pause the show before sitting down for the remainder of the performance. The following day, the musician <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>responded to fans' concern on Twitter</a>, writing that he "experienced weakness because of dehydration," but it was "nothing serious."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-paul-stanley-71></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Paul Stanley, 71</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Richard E.

He first linked up with his future KISS bandmate Simmons in the early 1970s, joining Simmons' group Wicked Lester.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Wicked Lester broke up in 1972, the pair teamed up with Peter Criss and later Ace Frehley to form KISS, a name Stanley came up with after taking inspiration from Criss' previous band Lips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After KISS' self-titled album debuted in 1974, Stanley decided to legally change his name to "Paul Stanley," citing marketing reasons in addition to the fact that he'd never been fond of his moniker. He also officially took on his KISS persona, the "Starchild," and became known for wearing a painted star over his right eye.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stanley released a self-titled solo album in 1978, followed by a second solo album, Live to Win, in 2006. He established a tribute band, Paul Stanley's Soul Station, in 2015 to play soulful music from the 1960s and 1970s. The group released its first album, Now and Then, in 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to collaborating with Simmons in KISS, Stanley has worked on a number of outside ventures with his bandmate, including the restaurant franchise Rock & Brews and a now-defunct football team called Los Angeles Kiss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his personal life, Stanley was married to actress Pamela Bowen for nine years until their divorce in 2001. The former couple share one son, Evan Shane, born in June 1994. In November 2005, the rocker married his second wife Erin Sutton, with whom he shares three children: son Colin Michael, born in September 2006; daughter Sarah Brianna, born in January 2009; and daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Grace</a>, born in August 2011.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There is nothing greater in life than family, and my accomplishments as a father rank at the top of my successes," he told PEOPLE in 2011.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ace-frehley-71></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ace Frehley, 71</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Fin Costello/Redferns ; Daniel Zuchnik/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Paul Daniel "Ace" Frehley was born on April 27, 1951, and grew up in the Bronx. After playing as a member of various bands through his teens, he officially joined KISS in January 1973, coming up with the group's iconic lightning bolt logo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Frehley took on the persona the "Spaceman," known for his over-the-top and out-of-this-world guitar style (during his solos, his signature Les Paul Custom guitar would <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>fill the stage with smoke </a>as he played).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite becoming one of the most popular guitarists in the world, Frehley was famously self-taught and never had any formal instruction. "I never took a guitar lesson, and just about every day, somebody comes up to me and says, 'If it wasn't for you, I never would have picked up a guitar,' " he said in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though he had success as an original group member, Frehley departed in December 1982, and was replaced by Vinnie Vincent. After leaving KISS, he formed his own band, Frehley's Comet, which put out two albums in 1987 and 1988. He also began a solo career, and released nine albums between 1978 and 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rocker later rejoined KISS in 1996 for a reunion tour, with all four original members performing together for the first time since 1980. In September 1998, the band released their 18th album together, Psycho Circus, the first to involve the original four members since their 1979 release, Dynasty. He left the group again in 2002.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite a brief reunion with his former bandmates on a sailing of the KISS Kruise in 2018, Frehley had harsh words for Simmons the following year. He responded to an interview given by Simmons where he claimed Frehley was unreliable and had been fired from the group three times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Gene, your memory is really incorrect!…" Frehley wrote on Facebook. "I was NEVER FIRED from KISS, I quit twice (not 3-times) of my own free will, because you and [guitarist] Paul [Stanley] are control freaks, untrustworthy and were too difficult to work with!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Frehley married Jeanette Trerotola in 1976, and they share a daughter Monique together. As of 2018, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>they were still legally married</a>, according to Frehley, though he has been engaged to Rachael Gordon since 2010.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-peter-criss-77></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Peter Criss, 77</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Al Pereira/Getty ; Mike Pont/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on Dec. 20, 1945, Peter George John Criscuola grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and is known by his stage name Peter Criss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He played with other bands in the mid-to-late 1960s, but joined KISS after Stanley and Simmons saw his advertisement in the East Coast edition of Rolling Stone. He developed the "Catman" persona and joined the newly formed group as their drummer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Criss also served as the lead singer on a few KISS songs, including their 1976 hit "Beth," for which he is credited as a co-writer. However, just a few years later in 1980, Criss ended up leaving the band, though the circumstances of his departure have been largely debated (Simmons and Frehley have both said that he was fired, while Criss maintains he quit).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After leaving KISS, Criss spoke to PEOPLE about some of his struggles while in the band. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>It always had to be Gene's way</a>. It was an ego thing," he said. "There's more to music than three chords."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, the musician was preparing to go on tour for Out of Control, his first of five solo albums. For his first venture outside of KISS, Criss explained he was aiming for "a more sophisticated following. I don't want to duck bottles anymore. I've had it with fire and bombs onstage. I see myself in a tux in Las Vegas."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He rejoined KISS along with Frehley in 1996 for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the group's reunion tour</a>, but left again in 2001 following a contract dispute. He returned by late 2002, but left permanently in March 2004 and was replaced by current band member Eric Singer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Outside of the band, Criss was married to his childhood sweetheart Lydia Di Leonardo from 1970 until 1979. He met former <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Playboy</a> playmate Debra Jensen while attending a party at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rod Stewart</a>'s mansion, and the pair married in 1979. They welcomed a daughter, Jenilee, together in 1981, but divorced in 1994. In May 1998, he married his third wife Gigi Criss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2007, Criss discovered a lump on his chest while working out. In February 2008, doctors removed a nodule from his breast, which they diagnosed as breast cancer. A surgery the following month removed the cancer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So many people must die from this," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he told CNN</a> in 2009.

He replaced Criss as KISS' drummer in 1980 and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>adopted the stage name</a> Eric Carr.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carr's first public performance with the group was on July 25, 1980, at the Palladium in New York City. Instead of using Criss' "Catman" persona, he came up with the "Fox" character. Music from "The Elder" was the first album he worked on with the group, and he also dabbled in guitar, bass guitar, piano and background vocals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In early 1991, Carr was diagnosed with heart cancer, and began undergoing a series of surgeries and chemotherapy. He was temporarily replaced by Eric Singer in KISS while he focused on his health, though he reportedly pleaded with Simmons and Stanley, as well as his doctors, to let him rejoin the band. After learning from Carr's doctors that he only had a few more months to live, Simmons and Stanley agreed to let him appear in the "God Gave Rock and Roll to You II" music video.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carr's final public appearance with the band was at the September 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. Shortly after, he died at the age of 41. The band dedicated the 1992 album Revenge to Carr, which contained "Carr Jam 1981," a demo he recorded after joining the group. In 1999, the musician's family, along with former KISS guitarist Bruce Kulick, posthumously released his solo album Rockology.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-eric-singer-64></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Eric Singer, 64</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty ; Daniel Knighton/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eric Singer was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 12, 1958. The drummer's father was a local bandleader and played a large role in influencing his love of music. Among Singer's other inspirations are bands including The Who, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Singer first joined KISS in December 1991 following the death of Eric Carr. He played on the band's 16th and 17th studio albums, Revenge and Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions, and embarked on several tours. In 1996, however, the band's first drummer Criss returned to the group when the original members reunited for the Alive/Worldwide tour. Singer stepped away, only to rejoin again in 2001. After temporarily departing once again in 2002, he permanently rejoined the band in 2004, and has remained a member ever since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Outside of KISS, Singer has toured and/or performed with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen</a>'s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Brian May</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Alice Cooper</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Black Sabbath</a> and more.

In addition to being part of their opening act, the rocker was involved with the band in various capacities before officially taking on the role of lead guitarist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1994, he began working with Simmons and Stanley on their book Kisstory, and managed their 1995 Worldwide Kiss Convention tour. He also served as a producer and editor of several long-form video and film releases for the group. Thayer officially joined the group as the lead guitarist during a private concert in Jamaica in March 2002, replacing Ace Frehley and wearing the "Spaceman" makeup and costume for the first time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Outside of the band, Thayer is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>involved in multiple charitable organizations</a>, including serving on the board of directors of the Arnold Palmer Education Fund and the Thayer Family Foundation.

In 1982, he was brought in as a replacement lead guitarist following Frehley's departure from the group. Like Carr, Vincent took on a different persona than his predecessor. He used the "Ankh Warrior" character, a look created by Stanley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His time in the group was short-lived, however, because he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>refused to sign the employment contract</a> offered by Simmons and Stanley and was reportedly fired after the end of the Lick It Up tour in March 1984.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-127 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After departing KISS, Vincent formed a new band, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, in the mid-1980s, and released two albums before breaking up in 1989. He briefly reunited with KISS in 1992, appearing as a songwriter on the album Revenge, but again butted heads with Simmons and Stanley during the project. ("Vinnie was up to his old tricks again," Simmons told Rolling Stone, alleging that Vincent sued the band over a contract dispute).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-129 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the release of his 1996 solo project Euphoria, Vincent retreated from public life. In 2018, however, he agreed to reunite with Simmons on stage for a performance to promote the latter's Vault collector's set. The former bandmates appeared in Nashville together that April, marking their first joint appearance in over two decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-131 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few years later, in May 2022, Vincent appeared with former KISS guitarists Ace Frehley and Bruce Kulick for a performance of four of the band's songs at Creatures Fest in Nashville.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-133 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his personal life, the guitarist shared twin daughters with his ex-wife AnnMarie Peters, who was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>murdered in 1998</a> after they had divorced. Vincent later cited his daughters as one of the reasons he refused to sign his initial contract with KISS.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-135 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had a family," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said in 2018</a>. "I had twins that I didn't know I was gonna have, and there was no money to take care of them, and there was no money to buy a home.

But I couldn't move on; there was no future."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-137 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1996, he married his second wife Diane Kero, an ex-girlfriend of Frehley whom he had met the previous year at a KISS convention in Chicago.

He only appeared in one video for the band, the hit single "Heaven's on Fire" from their Animalize album, the only album he was featured on. St. John reportedly clashed with other members of the band while recording Animalize, and Stanley later said they had trouble solidifying his solos due to a lack of "structure" in his playing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-145 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The musician's time in the group was cut short when he developed reactive arthritis, which caused swelling in his arms and hands. He was only able to perform two full shows and one partial show before Bruce Kulick began filling in for him, eventually officially replacing St. John in the band in December 1984.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-147 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following his time with KISS, St. John formed the band White Tiger and released a single album before they split in 1988. In 1990, he teamed up with former KISS member Peter Criss on a band called Keep, though they had trouble shopping their demo around. St. John ended up leaving the group, and Criss later renamed the band after himself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-149 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2006, St. John was incarcerated at the Theo Lacy Jail in Orange County, California, for possession of drug paraphernalia and attempted destruction of evidence.

During his time with the band, he appeared on five studio albums and two live albums.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-159 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kulick left KISS in 1996 following the Alive/Worldwide tour, which saw all four original members of the band reunite, though he did contribute to the group's 1998 album Psycho Circus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-161 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following his departure, Kulick formed the band Union in 1997, with whom he recorded three albums.
