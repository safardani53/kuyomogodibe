did come through correctly.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>“So I was able to call back and work everything out.”</p><p>Ken turned to the camera and said: “I guess the moral at home is if you get a crazy gargled voicemail with just the word Jeopardy!...”</p><p>The host's expression morphed into a wide-eyed stare: “Please call us! We’re trying to find you!”</p><h2>FANS REACT: 'REALLY?'</h2><p>Jeopardy! contestants send producers five topics they can be asked during the interview portion.</p><p>Fans on <a href=#>Reddit</a> were bothered that the story was selected since some people wait decades to get on Jeopardy!</p><p>One person wrote in a thread: “I'm surprised the show considers 'I screen calls from unknown numbers, so there was a brief delay before the Jeopardy! team got in touch with me' such a riveting story that they've chosen it to be featured so many times now.</p><p>"Nothing against the contestants, who are obviously being given limited prompts, but it seems to me that much of the life has been drained from the interview segments this season."</p><p>Another fan wrote: “Isn't there a way to have 'Jeopardy!' show up in recipients' caller ID?</p><p>"I realize scammers are able to do that, but at least prospective contestants would know to take the call."</p><p>A third wrote: “Do the casting folks not reach out via text and/or email as well? Is it really only a phone call?"</p><p>A contestant last month also <a href=#>told Ken he ignored "three calls" from Jeopardy!</a> as it was an unknown number and he’s a “classic millennial."</p><p>"Would it kill ya to pick up the phone!?" the host exclaimed then.</p><p>Scores going into Final Jeopardy were extremely close, with Brendan at $15,800, Amanda (who only bet $3,000 on the last Daily Double) at $11,000, and Joe at $12,800.</p><p>Final Jeopardy! under Global Geology read: “In this nation of 360,000 people, you can walk along the boundaries of the Eurasian & North American tectonic plates.”</p><p>Only Joe was correct with Iceland, adding $10,000 with $22,800 and looking happy enough to advance but certainly not thrilled.</p><h2>'WHAT IS: HE WEARING?'</h2><p>Joe first appeared last June wearing a form-fitting quarter-zip neon-patterned pullover.</p><p>Joe went viral for his outfit since he seemed a little underdressed for Jeopardy!</p><p>"Casual Joe," one fan posted on <a href=#>X</a> (formerly Twitter) at the time as another echoed: "Casual Tuesday."</p><p>A third wrote: "Ooh no. Clothing is usually irrelevant but a yoga shell suit won't do."</p><p>A fourth wrote: "Joe came straight from a bike race."</p><p>While a fifth spun up: "Why does joe look like he has jeopardy at 7 and the tour de france at 7:30?"</p><p>And yet another fumed: "Whatever the hell Joe is wearing is a disgrace to Jeopardy.
