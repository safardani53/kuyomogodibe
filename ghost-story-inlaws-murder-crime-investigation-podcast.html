It gripped me and made me wonder what was really going on.”</p><p>Tristan’s family moved out in 2006. He didn't think any more about it until his former neighbour Charles told him about other paranormal events in the home.</p><p>Charles told him about an American who showed up at the home and asked the new residents: “Do you still have that ghost in the top bedroom?”</p><p>The occupant was said to have gone “completely white” because it reminded her of claims made by her 10-year-old daughter.</p><p>Charles said: “This struck a chord because the daughter had always insisted there was a ghost in her bedroom, which would manifest itself on occasions and sit on her bed.</p><p>“She said to me, 'My daughter told me about some goings on, some faceless woman who sits on my bed' and she says, ‘I always batted them away…’”</p><p>Now, Tristan was aware of “three completely unconnected families” with “strange, inexplicable experiences” about the top floor and started to investigate.</p><h2>'Jealousy killing'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000853403462.jpg><p>Tristan questioned whether the “faceless woman” haunting his old home could be the deceased relative of his wife Kate Dancy – whose brother is Hannibal and <a href=#>Downton Abbey</a> star <a href=#>Hugh Dancy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The couple met at university and shared a flat together as friends. One night, before they had started dating, Tristan was visiting his family home and invited Kate and her grandad along - only for the latter to make an incredible revelation.</p><p>Kate recalls: “My grandad walked into the house and before he said anything else, he said, ‘My mother was murdered in the house next door.’”</p><p>Details of the murder were not spoken about by the family and younger relatives believed Naomi Dancy died a “natural death”.</p><p>In reality, she died after being shot in the face twice.</p><p>The family believed she was killed by her brother, Maurice Tribe, “out of jealousy” as he battled <a href=#>alcoholism</a> and <a href=#>PTSD</a> from <a href=#>World War 1</a>.</p><p>Maurice was blind in one eye following an injury in the war and due to his declining health, worsened by drink, was losing his sight in the other.</p><p>It was claimed he gunned Naomi down after developing “jealousy over his sister’s beautiful eyes”.</p><p>In a statement to police, Naomi’s husband John Dancy - also known as 'Feyther' - claimed Maurice had threatened her multiple times before and once “specifically threatened to shoot her eyes out”.</p><p>In the early hours of November 23, 1937, John said he heard three gunshots and raced out of a room to find Maurice pointing a revolver at his head.</p><p>“I realised he meant to shoot me,” John said. "I switched the light out and dropped to the floor. He shot as I fell and the bullet whizzed by my ear and went through the back window. I laid quite still and pretended that I was hit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/5a4282d8-2c28-4c67-a28e-c086cd1b4071.jpg><p>Maurice then locked himself in the bathroom and when John urged him to open it, he yelled: “Stand away from those panels or I’ll shoot you like a dog.”</p><p>John ran into the bedroom to find his wife “had been shot through both eyes" and described "blood spurting from one of her eyes”.</p><p>He returned to the lavatory and after forcing the door open found Maurice slumped over, saw a razor fall from his hand and discovered he had no pulse.</p><p>While police believed the account of John - whose memoir entries theorised his brother-in-law might have been after a valuable insurance policy - others didn't.</p><p>Detectives were sent two “barely legible” letters accusing Naomi’s husband of the killing.</p><p>One read: “Believe me, I’m not the only person over here who believes he murdered his wife and brother-in-law myself.”</p><h2>Cover up?</h2><p>In the podcast, Tristan brings in former detectives to look over the case and they discover multiple discrepancies.</p><p>They include Maurice’s hands being “suspiciously clean” and not covered in blood from his suicide and the razor that fell to the floor being found in his hand by police.</p><p>Among the experts was Jackie Malton, the homicide detective who inspired <a href=#>Dame Helen Mirren's character Jane Tennison</a> in the <a href=#>ITV</a> show <a href=#>Prime Suspect</a>.</p><p>She accuses police of not investigating the case properly and taking John’s account as “gospel truth” with little-to-no evidence to back up his claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackie says there was no proof that Maurice threatened to kill Naomi, nor that he killed her and tried to kill John to inherit £6,500 - roughly £370,000 today – from their insurance policy.</p><p>Those who knew Maurice, including his sister-in-law, also claimed the supposed killer would have “never threatened anyone” let alone “harm anyone”.&nbsp;</p><p>The theory that John “committed the perfect crime” and blamed Maurice is heavily investigated in Ghost Story.</p><p>Tristan also wonders whether he was haunted by Naomi to inspire him to investigate the case - and whether she had a hand in his love life.</p><p>He asks: “Did I end up marrying a family because a ghost wants me to solve a case that everyone has got wrong for nearly 100 years?”</p><p>Tristan says the "faceless woman" could have been present when he and his wife Kate went from friends to lovers.</p><p>He tells us: “We were both like, ‘Hang on, it was in that room that we got together. Does that mean that your great-grandmother was in the room?’</p><p>“It seemed such an absurd, totally ridiculous idea… that we were somehow being manipulated from the other side.</p><p>"But then the idea kept on coming back... It became one of the driving questions… Did we get married because of some kind of cosmic intervention?”</p><h2>Family backlash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/220222-supplied-lmkmedia-editorial-landmark-853407220.jpg><p>Tristan admits delving into such a “traumatic” part of his in-law’s family history wasn't easy and risked them “disowning” him.</p><p>In the podcast, one relative said: “If you come out with a piece that says he (John Dancy) is a murder I’ll be sorry we ever said we would contribute to it.”</p><p>Tristan’s wife Kate even admits the family will be “more traumatised by this podcast than we were the murder”.&nbsp;</p><p>He says it's been “a hard road” to get to the bottom of the case but he felt compelled to investigate because "something didn't feel right" about the official account.</p><p>Tristan says: “When you have a feeling there may be an injustice that has been committed in some way, you want to get to the bottom of what actually might have happened."</p><p>Reluctant to give away spoilers, he tells us he is still on speaking terms with his in-laws and his findings were "surprising".</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Tristan adds: "I think we've got to a place now where everyone is kind of at peace with where we've landed, but it hasn't been easy all the way along."</p><p><strong>Ghost Story from Wondery and Pineapple Street Studios launches on October 23.
