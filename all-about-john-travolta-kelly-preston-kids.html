Preston died in 2020 following a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>two-year battle with breast cancer</a>. She was 57.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple welcomed their first child, son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jett</a>, in April 1992. John was immediately enamored, telling PEOPLE of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>his newfound love of being a dad</a>. "After he was born and cleaned up, I held him for hours while Kelly slept," he said at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few years later, John and Kelly welcomed their second child, daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ella Bleu</a>, in April 2000. While Jett was born in a hospital, the actress gave birth to Ella in their Los Angeles home, which Kelly previously described as an "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>unbelievably beautiful</a>" experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2009, the Travoltas experienced tragedy when their eldest son, Jett, died at the age of 16 while on vacation with his family. John has often paid tribute to his late son, honoring his life with heartfelt throwback photos and sweet messages, in the years that followed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John and Kelly welcomed their third child, son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Benjamin</a>, in 2010. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>He's given the house a renewed spirit and purpose</a>," the Saturday Night Fever star told PEOPLE of their little "miracle" when he was born.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about John's three kids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jett></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jett</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John and Kelly welcomed their first child, son Jett, on April 13, 1992. Soon after he was born, the actor told PEOPLE how much he loved fatherhood. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I can't imagine what life would be like without Jett,</a>" he said in 1994.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, "After he was born and cleaned up, I held him for hours while Kelly slept. When they came to take him away for various tests, I said, 'No, you can't see him today. You'll have to do it another day.' I went a little nutsy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadly, Jett <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>died in January 2009 while on vacation</a> with his family in the Bahamas. The then 16-year-old had hit his head on a bathtub after suffering a seizure at his family's vacation home at the Old Bahama Bay Hotel on Grand Bahama Island.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rogers and Cowan/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John and his wife rarely spoke publicly about Jett, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kelly opened up in an interview</a> after his death. "[Jett] was autistic. He had seizures and when he was very young, he had Kawasaki Syndrome," she said while on an episode of The Doctors in November 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most recently, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>John paid tribute to Jett</a> with a throwback picture on what would have been his 30th birthday. "My dearest Jetty, I miss you more than words can say. I think about you everyday. Happy Birthday. Love, your Dad," he penned in the caption.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ella-bleu-23></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ella Bleu, 23</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>John Travolta/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John and Kelly welcomed their second child together, daughter Ella Bleu, on April 3, 2000. Like her parents, Ella has the performing bug. Throughout the years, John has beamed about his daughter's successes and touted that he's "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a very proud dad</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to starring in her own films, Ella has held several roles in her father's movies such as 2009's Old Dogs and 2019's The Poison Rose. In 2021, she nabbed her first lead in Get Lost, a modern-day retelling of the classic Alice in Wonderland story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only is she an actress in her own right, but she's also pursued a music career as well. Ella <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>released her first single</a>, "Dizzy," in January and shared <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a sweet video featuring her supportive dad</a> to celebrate the occasion.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ella and John Travolta.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>She is her own person</a>. She is gracious, generous, poised, graceful and gorgeous. I don't know how she came to be, and I don't take any credit other than just adoring her," John told PEOPLE of Ella in 2019. "And maybe that's a valid contribution."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most recently, Ella has continued to solidify her title as a multi-hyphenate after making her New York Fashion Week debut. John praised his daughter after she walked in the Karl Lagerfeld runway show for their Cara Loves Karl capsule collection in September.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John has often praised his daughter's endeavors but it was Ella's turn to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrate her famous father</a> when she marked his 69th birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Yesterday marked the birthday of my hero," Ella wrote on the Feb. 19, 2023, post, which featured a photo of the father-daughter duo posing together. "The most incredible father, friend and role model anyone could ask for. I love you, Daddy❤️❤️❤️."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Grease alum replied: "I love you too my dearest Ella. More than you know."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her spare time, Ella enjoys baking. She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>recreated the coconut bundt cake</a>&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tom Cruise</a> famously gives his friends around the holidays —&nbsp;and it was a big hit with her dad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It’s delicious, oh my goodness,” John said in a video on Instagram.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benjamin-13></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benjamin, 13</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>John Travolta and son Ben.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>John Travolta/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John and Kelly welcomed their third child, son Benjamin, on Nov. 23, 2010. Unlike his sister and parents, Ben hasn't demonstrated an interest in acting or music — rather, he possesses a unique talent of his own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>youngest Travolta is into parkour</a>, an impressive hobby the preteen has recently taken on. John shared his son's new interest on Instagram in April with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>a video showcasing his skills</a> at an indoor adventure gym.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the clip, Ben jumped between a series of objects by using monkey bars to swing across. At one point in the video, he did a quick touchback on the wall before making his way over to another platform. John has continuously posted his support for Ben and expressed that he is "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>so proud</a>."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>John Travolta/instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John and Ben share a very close bond. In August, the Saturday Night Fever actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up about the emotional conversation</a> he and his son had after Preston's death when Ben revealed he was afraid to lose his dad too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said, 'But you know, Ben … you always love the truth and I'm going to tell you the truth about life. Nobody knows when they're gonna go or when they're going to stay,' " John recalled of what he told his son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "Your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brother [Jett] left at 16</a>. Too young. Your mother left at 57. That was too young. But who's to say? I could die tomorrow. You could. Anybody can," he said. "So let's look at it like it's part of life. You don't know exactly.
