She's also the new face of a longtime fan-favorite beauty trend, the "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Get Ready with Me</a>" (GRWM), which originally gained popularity during the early 2000s YouTube era as a way for content creators to share their skincare and makeup routines while giving fans a look into their personal lives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The majority of Earle's TikToks see her recounting the everyday moments of her life while she does her makeup and chooses an outfit. And while her earlier GRWMs showed her preparing for class and tailgating at the Univerity of Miami, some of her more recent videos involve higher profile events as Earle's influencer career takes off. In December 2022, she took fans along while she got ready for a VIP night out at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Miley Cyrus</a>'s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>New Year's Eve party</a> in Miami.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, despite her growing fame, viewers still praise Earle for her "relatable" personality and down-to-earth lifestyle. Just a day after rubbing elbows with Cyrus, Earle posted a "room tour" <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video</a> of her disorganized college apartment. "This legitimately made me feel so much better about the fact that I am also just a messy girl," wrote one user in the comments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earle is also a burgeoning beauty guru — her white eyeliner makeup technique has inspired a host of copycat tutorials, and many of the products she regularly uses have been selling out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for her love life, Earle is dating Miami Dolphins wide receiver <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Braxton Berrios</a>. She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>confirmed their romance</a> in November 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who exactly is the TikTok celebrity?

"Little did I know these years would be the best years of my life. I've gained lifelong friends, made memories I'll never forget, and learned life lessons inside and out of the classroom. I can confidently say that The University of Miami has shaped me into the person I am today and I'm forever grateful I got the opportunity to attend such an amazing school."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her life as a college student was an integral part of her brand and persona in the early days of her TikTok career. Earle regularly featured her roommates in her TikToks, where they recounted their nights out at fraternity parties and Miami hotspots. Fans also followed the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>saga</a> of Earle's efforts to write a 25-page paper in December 2022, which she handed in just in time to celebrate her 22nd birthday.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-has-more-than-93-million-followers-on-tiktok-and-instagram></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She has more than 9.3 million followers on Tiktok and Instagram</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earle's reach continues to climb on both TikTok and Instagram.

In 2013, Earle's dad, Thomas (TJ) Earle, owner of a New Jersey-based construction company, eloped with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ashley Dupré</a> in Paris, five years after the former escort found herself wrapped up in a national political scandal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dupré was hired through the escort company she worked with at the time for a client she didn't realize was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>then-New York governor Eliot Spitzer</a>. In March 2008, the FBI launched an investigation after Spitzer's bank filed a suspicious funds report regarding payments that turned out to be for the escort service. A national scandal ensued, drawing Dupré into the spotlight and subjecting her to intense pressure and scrutiny. In the wake of the scandal, Spitzer resigned from office and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>his wife later divorced him</a>. Dupré was just 23 at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for their current family dynamic, Earle said everything is good between her parents and their new partners. "They're all, like, best friends," she said in a video getting ready to bring her mom, her mom's boyfriend, her dad and Dupré to a tailgate for her school's parents' weekend. "I'm so grateful for that situation."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-the-oldest-of-5-children></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She's the oldest of 5 children</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alix Earle Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earle is a big sister to four younger siblings. Her sister, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ashtin Earle</a>, regularly makes appearances on her Instagram and TikTok. Earle has also featured her three younger step-siblings, whom her father welcomed with Dupré, in various <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>TikToks</a> as well.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-gained-popularity-for-her-get-ready-with-me-videos></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She gained popularity for her "Get Ready with Me" videos</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alix Earle TikTok</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 22-year-old's first claim to fame is clear: her trademark "Get Ready With Me" videos. Not only are they the most consistent videos she posts on TikTok — she shares one for what seems like every day — but they are the key to her ever-growing fanbase. In addition to sharing her latest product recommendations, Earle also gets candid about her life with her followers, discussing everything from her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>decision to get a breast augmentation</a> to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>negative experience</a> with sorority recruitment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-been-very-open-about-her-acne-journey></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She's been very open about her acne journey</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A major part of the brand Earle has developed around herself is her honesty, and when it comes to her skin, she couldn't be more candid. She's kept her followers up to date with her four-month Accutane <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>journey</a>, filming a video with each month that passes while she's taking the medication to help ease her struggle with cystic acne. She shares <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>raw, unfiltered selfies</a> of her breakouts over the course of the months she's been taking the medication, and has been honest about the emotional toll of her acne.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I thought that my life was over, and I thought it was never gonna get better," she said in one Accutane update.

Earle chronicled much of their relationship on TikTok, taking followers along with her as she attended <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>weddings</a> with Wade and featuring him in her GRWMs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Wade was missing from her weekend-long birthday celebration in December, fans were quick to speculate that things had gone awry. Just three days after she turned 22, she uploaded one of her most-watched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>videos</a>, lip-syncing to an audio saying, "Damn, y'all broke up? Nah, she broke, I'm up." She later confirmed they were no longer together during a TikTok live, and shared that his hesitancy to post about their relationship on social media played a role in the breakup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earle took a trip to Los Angeles in early January, though, and met Wade for lunch. One fan spotted the pair together and shared the news on TikTok, prompting Earle to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>confirm</a> that they were in fact broken up, and had met for lunch on friendly terms.
