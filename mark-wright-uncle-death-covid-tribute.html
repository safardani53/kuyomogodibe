it pains me so much to say it, and I’ve got a lump in my throat right now, but we’re going to go through that quickly, and know that it’s been so tough for all of us," Mark said on his&nbsp;<a href=#

which way to turn, none of us would have ever been able to predict or imagine what’s gone on in this last year.</p><p>"So don’t feel bad if you’ve done something wrong, or you’ve dealt with it in the wrong way, or you’ve felt a little bit down, or you’ve let yourself down, because nobody, I reiterate, would have ever predicted this, but here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>“A year on and 26 million people

One of the leading countries when it comes to being vaccinated.</p><p>"I’ve had moments with my family, yes I’ve lost someone very special to me, but I’ve had moments with my family that I’ll never be able to replace."</p><p>Eddie lost his battle with Covid-19 in March after eight weeks of fighting off the deadly virus.</p><p>"You’d have to be God to find a better man than my uncle. Put simply, you won’t," Mark wrote on Elliott's tribute post at the time.</p><p>"I love you uncle Eddie, I’m never going to forget you.

May god look after you always and forever... until we meet again."</p><p>Former Towie cast member James Argent said: "I'm absolutely heartbroken, love you Elliott."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639696180.jpg><p>In January, Mark opened up about his family's Covid nightmare.</p><p>Earlier in the month,&nbsp;Mark revealed how his father Mark Snr, mother Carol and two uncles had all contracted the virus in what he described as "the scariest week of my life" over New Year.</p><p>Speaking on his Heart Radio evening show, the footballer said: "I want my life back.
