Jones via Zoom when he started telling her he "loved her" and she was his "sunshine", before sending her flowers and turning up unannounced at her work.</p><p>The final straw, that saw the woman report Jones' behaviour to the police, was when she locked eyes with him while among hundreds of thousands of others at&nbsp;<a href=#>Her Majesty's funeral</a>.</p><p>The man's "sinister smile" sent the 29-year-old into a panic attack as she scrambled to a <a href=#>police</a> officer, but all she could say was "stalker".</p><p>Ellie has now opened up about her 16 months of hell after Jones was given a <a href=#>five-year restraining order and suspended jail sentence</a> this week.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on stalking">Read more on stalking</h2><p>Speaking on <a aria-label="GB News Breakfast (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GB News Breakfast</a> today, Ellie revealed what unfolded on September 19 at <a href=#>Windsor Castle</a>.</p><p>She said: "And as you do in this job, the first question is always 'Ellie, where are you this morning?' And I said where I was.</p><p>"And it later transpired that he must have followed me from that position that I so publicly reported."</p><p>Ellie continued: "I headed down to the Long Walk in Windsor - 250,000 people were there by the way, a quarter of a million people.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>"And I looked up and there he was, like not even 10 feet away from my face, and he had his hands in his pocket - he'd obviously been there for a while - he had his hands in his pockets, staring at me and just smiling with the most sinister smile.</p><p>"It was like he was enjoying watching me being so uncomfortable. I was by myself.</p><p>"I walked away from my cameraman and that was my fault. And I just, I just went into a panic attack."</p><p>She said because it was the Queen's funeral there were police everywhere, and she ran to the closest officer.</p><p>Ellie continued: "I could still see where he was.</p><p>"I could not get out my words. I was just having a panic attack."</p><p>Jones took off, but was later arrested and spent a night in a cell.</p><p>The 42-year-old first made a name for himself on <a href=#>ITV</a>&nbsp;reality show&nbsp;<a href=#>Airline</a>, a show which ran from 1998 to 2006 and followed the lives of&nbsp;<a href=#>EasyJet</a>&nbsp;workers in airports.</p><p>He reinvented himself as a travel expert and started talking about the industry under&nbsp;<a href=#>Covid</a>&nbsp;restrictions - which is how he met Ellie.</p><h2>'MY SUNSHINE'</h2><p>She interviewed him over Zoom once in August last year, and then two months later.</p><p>After the second interview Jones suggested the pair present a&nbsp;<a href=#>travel</a>&nbsp;show together, the messaged: "I love seeing you in the morning X."</p><p>Over the next three days he messaged "you take my breath away", "you motivate me beyond words", "I love seeing you", and "you are my sunshine I love you".</p><p>He then messaged and asked: "How long do I have to wait to see you it is driving me insane."</p><p>That was when Ellie finally replied and said: "Please stop messaging me it is beyond inappropriate."</p><p>But the messages only stopped for three months - Jones then made a separate Instagram account.</p><p>He message Ellie saying "I know I'm not supposed to message you but thank you for everything you do for the travel industry" and "no one will ever come close to you."</p><h2>'FROM LEO X'</h2><p>Ellie then blocked all of his social media accounts.</p><p>But, Jones didn't stop there, in June this year he showed up at the GB News studio asking for Ellie, before sending flowers with a note that read: "Something to say a good morning from Leo X."</p><p>He also emailed the 29-year-old through her website that said: "Ellie I don't want to be like a stalker I have feelings for you you have been pivotal on my journey."</p><p>Then, just month's later, was the Queen's funeral.</p><p>Jones' year-long campaign left Ellie so scared for her safety that she suffered sleepless nights, constant stress and panic attacks.</p><p>She was also given a body guard, who taught her how to keep herself safe.</p><p>At Jones' hearing on Thursday Ellie read her victim impact statement at <a href=#>St Albans Magistrates' Court</a> from behind a curtain.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>Speaking this morning, she said: "I think I feel like that was something he would have wanted, to see me or be close to me, or something like that.</p><p>"So I didn't want him to have that but I did want him to hear what had done to me."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ellie-costello-reveals-year-stalker-778122999-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ellie-costello-reveals-year-stalker-778190062.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Are you being stalked?</h3></p><p>IF you are a victim of stalking, tell a friend, secure your social media, contact the police and call the National Stalking Helpline on 0808 802 0300.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpgaoJ6fZhqZp6knJ6ybq%2FOrKuepJykerOx1Z6YpatdqMGiuMqeqWaln6Kyr8CMqqyenZ6oeqfBzZ6pmqRf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jennifer-lawrence-reacts-leonardo-dicaprio-dont-look-up-movie-salary.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jennifer Lawrence Reacts To Leonardo DiCaprios Dont Look Up Salary Hollywood Life</a>
