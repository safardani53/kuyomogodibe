Meaning your whole life isn’t just about yourself.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/maya-ethan-variety-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ethan’s eldest child, Maya, has made headlines more than once over the years. As a working actress, the <i>Stranger Things </i>cast member followed in her dad’s footsteps, and the two have even worked together. During a September 2023 interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Variety</i></a>, the father-daughter duo reminisced about working on their indie film <i>Wildcat</i>. Though Maya was proud to portray<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a complex role</a> in the movie, the pair acknowledged that they were criticized over nepotism.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“If someone wants to criticize us for working together, that’s totally fair,” Ethan pointed out. “You have to let people have their opinion. You just have to try to do a good job when you’re on stage.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, Ethan didn’t hesitate to note that he’s “a nepo dad,” and he is “not embarrassed about it.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Scroll down to read more about Ethan’s four incredible children!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Maya Hawke</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The highly accomplished actress doesn’t need her dad or mom, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Uma Thurman</b></a>, to advance her career! The <i>Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood </i>star previously revealed that Ethan helped her get the role in the <b><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Quentin Tarantino</a>–</b>directed project. However, she noted that auditions weren’t the single perk she wanted from having a famous family.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I’m always running decisions by them,” Maya told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Wall Street Journal </i></a>in July 2019. “They both have similar levels of success but really different experiences within the business. I think that’s the biggest advantage [I have], that I have information about the pitfalls and the good things. Hopefully it’ll keep me from making some mistakes that young actors can make.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Maya was born on July 8, 1998, less than two years after her parents met and fell in love on the set of <i>Gattaca</i>. Though Uma and Ethan divorced in 2005, they have maintained a strong presence in their daughter’s life.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The actress is set to reprise her role as Robin in the fifth and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>final season of Stranger Things</a>, which has not started filming yet. She also plays Jamie Bernstein in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a>‘s Leonard Bernstein drama, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Maestro</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In addition to working as an actor, Maya is also a singer-songwriter. She released her first single, “To Love a Boy,” in 2019 and has since recorded more music.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Levon Hawke</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Ethan and Uma welcomed their second child, Levon, on January 15, 2002. Throughout his young adult years, Levon has expressed an interest in fashion, accompanying his mother to various couture shows.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Like his older sister and parents, Levon has appeared in various film projects. One of his most notable television roles was alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Tom Holland</b></a> in Apple TV+’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The Crowded Room</i></a>, which premiered in June 2023.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Clementine Hawke</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Ethan shares Clementine with his second wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Ryan Hawke </b></a>(née Shawhughes), whom the <i>Sinister</i> actor married in 2008. The spouses welcomed Clementine in July of that year. Though the teen hasn’t made as many public appearances as her half-siblings, Ethan has spoken about his youngest daughter over the years. During a March 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>PEOPLE</i></a>, the <i>Dead Poets Society</i> cast member revealed that Clementine wasn’t always impressed with her dad’s film projects.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“My 13-year-old saw the <i>Moon Knight</i> trailer and all of the sudden, my being an actor was real to her,” Ethan told the outlet about Clementine. “She watched it on her phone. She’s like ‘Dad, this looks really good.’ I mean her eyes just went [wide]; she couldn’t believe it. ‘That’s what the kids at school are talking about.’ So. this is the first one that [impressed] her.” <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Indiana Hawke</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>In addition to Clementine, Ethan and Ryan share a second daughter named Indiana, whom they welcomed in July 2011. Indiana isn’t frequently seen out and about with her family, but Maya gave Instagram users a rare glimpse of her younger half-sister in 2020. At the time, the <i>Wildcat</i> actress shared a video to the social media platform that included Indiana singing along with her to the song, “To Live Is to Fly.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Stn5qmXZ2uuLfEZqKinKNignKBl2tqbWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tv-couples-we-need-to-see-together-in-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;TV Couples We Need to See Together in 2024</a>
