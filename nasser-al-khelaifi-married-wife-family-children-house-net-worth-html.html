His growing influence in the sport was recognized in 2015 and was crowned 'favorite Ligue&nbsp;1 president’ in a poll conducted by France Football.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Elle Duncan Married With Husband And It's Forever; ESPN Beauty On Parents & More" rel=follow>Elle Duncan Married With Husband And It's Forever; ESPN Beauty On Parents & More</a></p><p>In 2016, the French daily sports newspaper L'Équipe entitled him the 'Most powerful man in French football' in a 30-man list.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Nasser Al-Khelaifi Sports Accolades: Net Worth In Billions</strong></h3><p>Nasser Al-Khelaifi was into Tennis from&nbsp;his early age and carved&nbsp;out a&nbsp;career as a professional tennis player. During his tennis playing days, he was friend with&nbsp;the emir of Qatar,&nbsp;Sheikh Tamim, with both sharing a keen interest in tennis. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As a tennis player, Nasser played two games in the ATP calendar and reached a career-high ranking of 995. His double's career was more successful and also represented Qatar in the Davis Cup.&nbsp;</p><p>After ending his playing career, he moved into sports administration and&nbsp;has been president of the Qatar Tennis Federation since November 2008. What's more, he was chosen as the chairman of Qatar Sports Investment(QSI) in 2011. Shortly after being selected as the president, QSI bought the French football team, Paris Saint Germain(PSG). Under his stewardship, PSG has risen the ranks and are the most successful French side in this decade.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="CBS Reporter Greg Gumbel, A Family Man With Wife; Cancer Victim?" rel=follow>CBS Reporter Greg Gumbel, A Family Man With Wife; Cancer Victim?</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>What's more, PSG has become a household name in the European football. As the president of PSG, the club has housed stellar names in the world of football including David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and lately Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.</p><p>Moreover, in February 2012, he won a French 'Sports&nbsp;Business' award, receiving the most votes out of 1,500 and finishing ahead of nine people.</p><p>The QSI he chairs is worth more than a 100 billion dollars, and beIN media is one of the most successful sports media houses in the middle east.

His team's spending has fallen foul of the financial fair play (FFP) in an investigation by UEFA. What's more, he was accused of gifting his Sardinian house worth $6 million as a bribe to FIFA secretary Jerome Valcke in exchange of world cup hosting rights for 2022, which was awarded to Qatar in controversial circumstances. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Not just that, the Qatar native had his house searched by the investigators, and he was questioned in regards to the corruption scam.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Nasser Al-Khelaifi Hopes Real Madrid Respects PSG</strong></h3><p>The PSG president is undoubtedly on point when it comes to talking business, and he prefers face to face talk rather than behind backs stabbing. This manner came into action all over again in September 2018 when Real Madrid tried its hands to land Neymar just a year on from his record transfer from Barcelona.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><strong>Explore:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Is Graham Bensinger Gay?
