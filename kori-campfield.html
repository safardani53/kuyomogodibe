What is her nationality?</h2><p>For those who want to know, Kori Campfield, like most celebrity wife came to fame after her marriage to WWE star Kofi Kingston. The beloved wife Kori was born in Accra, Ghana, before she moved to the states, aka the land of dreams.</p><p>Since she spent most of her time on another continent, there are not many details on her childhood. Some standard information like the name of her parents, their profession, and whereabouts are still missing.</p><p>Likewise, the same is the case when it comes to her siblings as well. Not to mention, Kori’s academic qualifications are also not known. Nonetheless, Campfield must be an educated person.</p><p>Other than that, Kori’s nationality is Ghanian, and as for her ethnic background, she is African.</p><h2>How old is Kori? |&nbsp; Age and Height</h2><p>On multiple occasions, we have seen Kofi accompanied by his beautiful wife, Kori Campfield. With her slim yet curvy figure, Kori looked stunning in every one of her public appearances. Along with that, her long dark brown hair and a pair of coffee-colored eyes enhanced Kori’s beauty.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin Manning Kellerman Age, Brother, Net Worth, Husband, Career, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Likewise, judging by her appearance alone, it is hard to believe Campfield is already in her late 30s. Yes, this stunning diva is 38 years old as of now. She was born on April 21, 1982, where her zodiac sign happens to be Taurus.</p><p>From what we know, the people under this sign are known for their stubbornness, passion, and determination. Other than this, she has not revealed her body measurements like her height and weight. We will make sure to update you on those soon.</p><h2>What is Kofi Kingston Net Worth? How much does Kori Campfield earn in a year?</h2><p>When it comes to Kori, most parts of her life and career have been nothing but a mystery. Aside from her education and family, the celebrity wife has kept her career out of media attention. Hence, it is hard to pinpoint her profession.</p><p>However, some sources claim that this beloved WWE wife has earned a net worth of <strong>$100k</strong>. So, where does the money come from? No clue. But for now, the numbers are there.</p><p>Meanwhile, we know exactly where and how her husband, Kofi Kingston, gets his pay. As of now, the WWE superstar has accumulated a net worth of <strong>$3 million.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Other than his worth, the Ghanaian-American wrestler earns <strong>$500k</strong> from his salary alone. As we all know, Kofi is a WWE superstar and has been in this field since the beginning of 2006.</p><h2>What is Kori Campfield’s job? | Professional Career</h2><p>As mentioned above, there is no information or details giving insights into Kori’s profession and career. Just like her childhood, education, and life, the information is practically non-existent.</p><p>Despite the absence of information, it has not stopped people from making various speculations. For example, many sources claim, the celebrity wife, Kori, might be a housewife at the moment, tending after their two beloved sons.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tammy Bradshaw Age, Husband, Daughters, Philanthropy, Net Worth, IG >></a></h4><p>However, Campfield has made a few television appearances where she is seen supporting her husband.</p><p>Since she is the wife of one of the famous WWE wrestlers, Kofi Kingston, it is hard to run from media attention and paparazzi. Still, Kori has managed to stay low profile and keep her family from any further media attention.</p><h2>Meet the wife of WWE superstar Kofi Kingston- Marriage and Children</h2><p>Now, talking about their relationship, Kofi and Kori are a married couple who tied the knot sometime in 2010. But, unfortunately, very little information is shared when it comes to their relationship, both before and after the marriage.</p><p>But some speculate the two must have known each other for a long time. Besides that, they had a beautiful engagement ceremony before tying the knots.</p><p>Nonetheless, just like other things, their wedding took place in an intimate manner where only their close family and friends attended. Fast forward to today, the couple is parents to two beautiful children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kori-001.jpg><p>Similarly, Kori gave birth to their first child, a son in 2013 who was named<strong> Khi</strong>. And later, in April 2016, Campfield welcomed their second child, also a son, called <strong>Orion</strong>. But, as expected from Kori, aside from their names, other details are barely there out in public.</p><p>But it seems, Kori like any other celebrity and wrestling personalities are active on social media- especially Facebook.</p><p>From there, we got some details of her personal life, like how the small family of four resides in their house in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>Moreover, Kori is also friends with other wrestling names such as <strong>Santino Marella</strong> and <strong>Natalie “Natalya” Neidhart</strong>. Funny enough, her account is nothing when it comes to her husband, who is far from active.</p><h2>Kofi Kingston | WWE Career</h2><p>Talking about the man of the hour and beloved husband, Kofi Kingston is a renowned professional wrestler.
