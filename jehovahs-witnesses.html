at a press conference when she said she won’t be celebrating her daughter Olympia’s first birthday next month due to her Jehovah’s Witness faith.</p><p>“Olympia doesn’t celebrate birthdays,” the 36-year-old said. “We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, we don’t do that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Witnesses</a>&nbsp;is their frequent door-knocking to try and convert you, a surprising number of celebs - including Serena's sister <a href=# rel=noopener>Venus</a> and model&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Naomi Campbell</a>&nbsp;- are followers or were raised in the faith.</p><p>And there are unusual rules members have to follow: they can't have life-saving blood transfusions, are unable&nbsp;to vote or date without chaperones being present - and are forbidden from having oral sex both in and out of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429566713.jpg><h2>Celebrity followers going door-to-door</h2><p>Serena and sister Venus were raised as Jehovah's Witnesses by their mother Oracene Price, who converted to the religion in the 1980s.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Serena</a> has been more outspoken about the religion - which was started in the 1870s in the US - constantly thanking "Jehovah God" for her success as a tennis player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000342710274.jpg><p>In a recent Vogue interview she also said: "Being a Jehovah’s Witness is important to me, but I’ve never really practiced it and have been wanting to get into it.</p><p>"Alexis [Serena's husband] didn’t grow up going to any church, but he’s really receptive and even takes the lead. He puts my needs first.”</p><p>Legendary singer <a href=# rel=noopener>Prince</a>, who passed away in April 2016, converted to the faith in 2001 following the death of his mother.</p><p>He described his conversion as: "a realisation. It's like Morpheus and Neo in The Matrix".</p><p>A committed Jehovah's Witness to the end, a memorial for the star took place at the&nbsp;Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses near his Minnesota home to commemorate his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0003759874811.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429621776.jpg><p>Canadian model <a href=# rel=noopener>Coco Rocha</a>&nbsp;has opened up about her life as a devout Jehovah's Witness saying: "faith is everything" and despite her fame, she still preaches door-to-door.</p><p>"The whole purpose is to inform people. Some people think we’re a pushy religion, but if you’re not interested, just say so," she explained to luxury magazine Dujour.</p><p>Naomi Campbell's mum Valerie is also a follower, telling Vogue: "I brought up Naomi as a Jehovah's Witness, but she must choose her faith for herself. I do give her literature on the subject though when she asks for it."</p><p>However, the model has not followed in her mother's footsteps by becoming a believer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004059142451-e1535551181560.jpg><p>Other A-list celebs, including Janet Jackson, Ja Rule and actress Michelle Rodriguez were raised in the faith as children, but no longer practise it.<br></p><h2>What do Jehovah's Witnesses believe?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429621848.jpg><p>Members follow their own version of the Bible called the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</p><p>They say our world now belongs to Satan, and because of this God&nbsp; - who they call Jehovah - will end it very soon in order to create a new kingdom.</p><p>Jehovah's Witnesses are not meant to make friends with people of other faiths, as non-believers are considered to belong to "Satan's world" - although this isn't always strict as their celebrity followers show.</p><p>Many followers say there is a a sense of community that can come with being a Jehovah's Witness - as they are tight-knit and have respect for each other.</p><p>The easy-to-follow belief system is also a big draw for people interested in the faith, and the organisation has a lot of literature providing what they believe to be the answers to life's big questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429621862.jpg><p>A Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall: followers of the faith reject blood transfusions as they are seen as 'sinful'</p><p>Jehovah's Witnesses are barred from having blood transfusions - which makes operations like Caesarean sections - that often require them - more difficult to complete, as blood products are linked to immorality.</p><p>As one Jehovah's Witness told the New Yorker: "It’s as much a sin to take a blood transfusion as to have an extramarital affair".</p><p>This has led to several deaths - and various court battles between Jehovah's Witnesses and doctors seeking to treat them.</p><p>Last Autumn, a 27-year-old Canadian new mother,&nbsp;Éloïse Dupuis, died a week after giving birth due to haemorrhaging - but despite doctors' pleas for her to have a blood transfusion she refused.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429621651.jpg><p>Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in sex before marriage - and dating isn't condoned unless they bring along a chaperone as well.</p><p>So it's likely that the first person you choose to date will be the person you marry.</p><p>And after marriage, there's still restrictions on sex - namely anal and oral sex which are strictly forbidden, something that is also frowned upon in religions such as Islam and other forms of Christianity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429621852.jpg><p>Followers are peaceful - even refusing military service - but are suffering from persecution in some countries.</p><p>Earlier this year, they were declared as an "extremist group" in Russia with raids on their Kingdom Halls and several arrests - it's thought hundreds have fled the country and applied for asylum in Finland since.</p><p>Other things they are prohibited from doing include being patriotic, as it is seen as "worshipping an idol", or voting or canvassing for political parties as they remain politically neutral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429621777.jpg><p>As Jesus never celebrated his birthday, Jehovah's Witnesses don't mark theirs' either, and they don't acknowledge the major Christian holidays of <a href=# rel=noopener>Christmas Day</a>&nbsp;or Easter, as they believe&nbsp;these festivals are based on pagan customs.</p><p>On the plus side, it means they probably save a lot of money due to not having to fork out for expensive gifts.</p><h2>Beliefs in the end of the world - and controversey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004296218651.jpg><p>Their beliefs in the end of the world have led to a series of unfulfilled prophecies.</p><p>In 1975 they were told the world would end and members were encouraged to preach full-time and get rid of their possessions.</p><p>Thousands of them&nbsp;quit their jobs and sold their homes - but Armageddon didn't come leading to a drop in membership, something which has remained in decline ever since.</p><p>Armageddon was also promised before the start of the Millennium, but again never materialised.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429621942.jpg><p>There has also been other controversies: the <a href=#>Charity Commission are currently investigating</a>&nbsp;claims that some followers were abused as children by fellow members of the faith.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Children who were raped by Jehovah's Witnesses told NOT to report abuse</span><h2>Major recruitment drives</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004296218601.jpg><p>Members are known for their recruitment drives: previously, they would go door-to-door to try and recruit new converts, handing out literature that explains their beliefs.</p><p>However, people who have left have described this as being "exhausting".</p><p>One said: "I barely got any sleep when I was a Witness...I needed the weekends to catch up on my sleep debt, but instead I had to get up at the crack of dawn to go out preaching.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004296218501.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in news</h2></p><p>Followers of the religion are now more commonly found preaching outside train stations across the UK, and in London alone their volunteers give out an estimated 100,000 magazines every month.</p><p>The publication, Awake!, has been running since 1919, and with a global circulation of&nbsp;65 million they show no sign of stopping recruiting any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbH5zgJVwa2iilZ28t63HrGSwoaSjsrS%2FxKxm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rhoc-cast-changes-rumors-tamra-judge-alexis-bellino.html>&#171;&nbsp;RHOC fan-favorite alums in talks to rejoin show as Bravo villain is SNUBBED from cast shakeup</a>
