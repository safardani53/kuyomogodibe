Needless to say, you already know you can find us watching Bravo every Monday at 9 p.m. for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Now, without further ado, here's your first look at the <a href=#>Below Deck Season 7 new cast</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Captain Lee Rosbach</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We think it's important to start with the VIPs and familiar faces (after all, Below Deck never lets viewers forget how it all comes down to rank when one's at sea), which is why <a href=#>Captain Lee Rosbach</a> is first in line.</p><p>Captain Lee has been with the Bravo reality hit since Day 1, and can we remind you all that he is known in maritime circles as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Stud of the Sea</a>? HOT, we know.</p><p>Follow the Captain on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Kate Chastain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chief Stew and HBIC Kate Chastain is also returning for her sixth trip with Captain Lee, and from the looks of Season 7 sneak peeks, she is about to reach the end of her line. "Go find another chief stew," she says at one point to fellow Below Deck alum Ashton Pienaar. "I quit."</p><p>Is she full of empty threats or will we actually be seeing Valor cruise around Thailand without our favorite stewardess?&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Kate on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Ashton Pienaar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I think we have the most attractive deck crew I've ever worked with," Kate says in a preview ahead of the season.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to heading the exterior team, Ashton Pienaar is the new man in charge. Hailing from Johannesburg, South Africa, <a href=#>we first met Ashton last season when he fell overboard and scared the entire crew of My Seanna.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, he's been promoted from deckhand to bosun and we can't wait to see what the season has in store for him.</p><p>Follow Ashton on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Simone Mashile</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Also a native of South Africa is second stewardess Simone Mashile, who has a degree in mathematics and held an office job before leaving her 9-to-5 for maritime adventures, as many Below Deck crew members are wont to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that she's made her dream of traveling a reality, she jumps around the French Riviera as a stewardess and sous chef and lives by the motto: "I am the master of my destiny, I am the captain of my soul." Sounds inspiring! Let's see if the rest of the crew members think so as well.</p><p>Follow Simone on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Courtney Skippon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Courtney rounds out the interior team as the third stewardess, and she got started in yachting after moving to France with the intention of attending business school. When she needed some income to supplement her lifestyle as a student in Paris, she landed on a charter boat and the rest is history.</p><p>Now, she's left her business days behind her and has been focusing on yachting as her new career passion.</p><p>Follow Courtney on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Brian de Saint Pern</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lead deckhand Brian de Saint Pern grew up in South Africa as well, so we can't wait for the mix of accents aboard the Valor (honestly, aren't the accents half the reason we watch?) this season.&nbsp;</p><p>Brian has been yachting for four years, and started surfing, swimming and playing water polo way before that. Since he decided to pursue yachting, he's been working on charter vessels along the Mediterranean, and is looking to earn his First Mate/Officer certification.</p><p>On a personal level, he has a 5-year-old daughter, Micah.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Brian on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Tanner Sterback</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Deckhand Tanner has always been free-spirited, athletic, and in love with the ocean, so he sounds really well primed to join the exterior team on Valor this season. He grew up in Long Island, then moved to California to pursue the surfer lifestyle and worked as a lifeguard at the Coppola Winery.</p><p>Soon, he decided to trade in the surf for a more stable career that would still give him the chance to travel and explore, which is how he got started in yachting. When he's not on board, he can be seen traveling in a van with his adorable dog Tito.</p><p>Follow Tanner on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Abbi Murphy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Preview clips already show deckhand Abbi hooking up with her boss Ashton, so we are eager to see how that is going to play itself out over the rest of the season. Tensions are even higher considering the fact that we see Ashton ask Captain Lee to let him continue the charters with a man down on the exterior midseason, so we're wondering if the yacht romance led to professional differences, or if Ashton is referring to someone else entirely.</p><p>Either way, Abbi was a lawyer before she took a sailing vacation around Greece that changed her life. After that, she quit her job at a law firm and decided to dedicate her time to learning how to sail. Outside of being a deckhand on Below Deck, she works as a first mate in Greece with the same company that attracted her to sailing.</p><p>Follow Abbi on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Kevin Dobson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Lastly but perhaps most importantly aboard the Valor is chef Kevin Dobson, who's from Lake Tekapo, New Zealand. We haven't heard his name much in the preview clips for the season, which bodes well for Kevin considering <a href=#>the long lineage of chefs we saw come and go</a> from Season 4 of Below Deck Med.</p><p>Considering he started his culinary career at age 14 and has moved up the ranks of the hospitality world, we expect things will be smooth sailing for Kevin. When he's not out yachting, the chef is based out of Melbourne, where he tries to spend as much time as he can with his baby daughter.</p><p>Kevin isn't on Instagram but we're excited to see his creations on board!</p><p>New episodes of Below Deck air Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7Ktu9Zmm56bm2LApq3SqKVmb12jsrh5wpqqrQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rhonys-jenna-lyons-boosted-net-worth-by-leading-us-retailers-rise.html>&#171;&nbsp; RHONYs Jenna Lyons boosted net worth by leading US retailers rise Tue 18 October 2022 14:</a>
