predictions as coronavirus grips the country.</p><p>But as Heath Secretary <a href=#>Matt Hancock insists the second wave is levelling off</a>, analysis shows the grimmest forecasts that plunged us into a second lockdown haven't materialised.</p><p><strong>⚠️ Read our <a href=#>coronavirus live blog</a> for the latest news & updates</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/VP-GRAPH-CRITICAL-CARE.jpg><p>Here we take a look at some of the alarming projections from scientists and the Government, and see how they shape up with NHS data and statistics.&nbsp;</p><h4>How do critical hospital admissions or beds compare with the last five years?</h4><p>Hospital bed occupancy for the beginning of this month was actually lower than the five-year average for November.</p><p>Data from November 5 - the most recent date on record - showed the number of beds occupied in England were 113,474, compared to the higher 114,767 on the same day last year.&nbsp;</p><p>The number of people in ICU beds is also currently lower than normal for this time of year, with approximately 70 per cent currently full, compared to 80 per cent in previous years.</p><p>While the Government released a graphic yesterday showing a rise in hospital admissions since the summer, the figure is actually in line with normal for this time of year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/VP-GRAPH-HOSPITAL-BED-1.jpg><p>The drop in hospital bed occupation will largely be due to procedures and planned appointments being cancelled or delayed, which would have taken place if the pandemic hadn't hit.</p><p>Earlier this year it emerged the government's <a href=#>stark 'Protect the NHS' warning may have actually cost lives, as many with life-threatening conditions and cancers didn't seek help they needed.</a></p><p>It has been reported the messaging - which was later withdrawn - saw hospital admissions plummet by 90 per cent.&nbsp;The Government now strongly urges anyone with serious symptoms to visit A&E or see a GP.&nbsp;</p><h4>Are hospitals close to full capacity?</h4><p>Many hospitals and medics are under pressure from another influx of coronavirus patients, but this is not the case in all UK hospitals and they are not at full capacity.</p><p>Only 13 per cent of beds in NHS hospitals are filled with Covid-19 patients.</p><p>Data from the Department of Health said 14,479 people were in hospital on November 17, a drop from the previous day which had 16,271 Covid inpatients.</p><p><a href=#>Covid-19&nbsp;</a>patients account for around 10 per cent of general and acute beds in hospitals. But, there are still more than 13,000 beds available.</p><p>And we <a href=#>still have the Nightingale hospitals around the country allowing for more capacity should the NHS struggle for beds once more.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/covid-19-impaitents-21.11.20.jpg><h4>How many people dying of the virus had underlying health conditions?</h4><p>95 per cent who have died in England from the virus have largely had pre-existing conditions.</p><p>Out of the tragic 37,796 deaths in NHS England hospitals up to November 20, 35,806 had <a href=#>underlying conditions.</a></p><p>There have been only 42 deaths of people under the age of 40 who didn't have underlying health problems.</p><p>And more than half of those who died in England were over the age of 80.</p><h4>Are intensive care beds are full?</h4><p>No, while under pressure due to Covid admissions, ICUs are still able to admit other patients.</p><p>Capacity is tracking as around normal with the number of beds available that would be expected at this time of year.</p><p>Data shows that even in the peak in April, critical care beds were on average never more than 80 per cent full.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000574158347-e1588369907177.jpg><h4>Are more dying now than last year?</h4><p>Compared to the five-year average of deaths, the current numbers show we are relatively in line with that.</p><p>Deaths per week spiked earlier this year as the virus took hold and we saw a huge difference compared to the average.</p><p>But now it is roughly the same, with deaths running up to November 10 recorded at 10,887, and the five-year average for the same period at 10,861.</p><p>Deaths would be starting to spike in normal years as we get into winter and the<a href=#> flu season.</a></p><p>But with more people staying inside and practicing social distancing, we could see flu infections and deaths not as high as usual.</p><h4>Are more dying now than in the first wave?</h4><p>No, we are seeing less deaths than the peak of the pandemic in April.</p><p>Doctors have more knowledge and experience of the disease and can therefore manage and treat it better.</p><p>In April the daily average of deaths was 838 at one point, partly so high due to infected patients being sent in huge numbers to care homes where the disease rapidly spread.</p><p>In comparison we are seeing around 500 new deaths daily at the moment, with a total of 54,626.</p><p>And in another sign the peak is dropping, <a href=#>today's daily deaths were 341.</a></p><p>This is the lowest Saturday rise this month after 462 more died last Saturday and 413 the week before.</p><p>It comes after <a href=#>Government scientific advisers predicted a terrifying 500,000 deaths if we didn't go into lockdown in March.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-graphic-UK-deaths-cases-combined-linegraph-nov-21.jpg><h4>Are more elderly dying than normal?</h4><p>Elderly people are more at risk from the virus and have largely been the victims, but aren't dying more than normal.</p><p>Data up to November 18 showed that 53.7 per cent of people who died from Covid in England were over 80 years old.</p><h4>Is the infection rate rising?</h4><p>The infection rate in the UK is currently falling again.</p><p>After tier restrictions and now the second lockdown, the country is seeing falling infection rates.</p><p>The <a href=#>coronavirus R rate has fallen for the second week in a row- with only the South East above 1, the latest official data shows.</a></p><p>The current R value - the number of people an infected person will pass Covid-19 on to - is estimated to be between 1.0 and 1.1.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000609983502.jpg><h4>The worst case forecast deaths vs actual current daily death toll:</h4><p>Death graphs used to justify a second Covid lockdown in England were branded <a href=#>"misleading" by experts who said they are "mathematically incorrect".</a></p><p>Heat maps presented to the general public ahead of a second lockdown&nbsp;made for scary viewing as the colour coded charts showed the pandemic was out of control.</p><p>They predicted a worst case scenario of more than 4,000 deaths a day by December.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>But, one of the scientists who worked on that study, said the data was presented incorrectly.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Professor Danlela de Angelis said the curve was made to look like a prediction, when in fact it was a model that was a month old and did not take into consideration the tier restrictions that had previously been introduced.</p><p>The Cambridge model has since revised its estimates which are around 1,000 deaths by the start of December.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Matt Hancock insists Covid rules must be followed if Britain is to enjoy a 'normal' Christmas</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoBzgo9qbm5nk6TDqrCMrKuarKNiv6bCxJqjnpxdmbKiwMesZKKbpWK1sL%2FPoquapF2XsqW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jesse-money.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jesse Money- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</a>
