Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen use this self-care hack frequently as a way to rejuvenate the place on your face that is over-talked and underappreciated. In addition to hydration, dermatologic surgeon Mary L.

Testing for how the masks felt on the skin and the overall hydration and look after use, we crafted a list of our favorite lip masks, keeping in mind different needs like sensitive skin and duration of use. Then we continued testing these lip masks at home for six months and thus, created our best list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the lip masks PEOPLE considers the best for hydration, look, and overall feel.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-laneige-lip-sleeping-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kmtkw3MlsUKbuwQAHCz_pLUYC7M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lanegie-e71c32fa41fa478895308ed92b396cdb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=0><p>Locks in moisture, keeping your lips soft and supple overnight and throughout the day</p></li><li readability=0><p>Has vitamin C and antioxidants which boosts hydration and collagen production and prevents environmental damage to your skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As seen on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sydney Sweeney</a>, this popular lip mask is a rescue for those with dry lips. For those on our team who struggle with dry and parched lips, we could tell an immediate difference after applying this mask. The mask left our lips feeling extra glossy and made them look super soft and supple. With ingredients like vitamin C and antioxidants, this formula works to moisturize your lips and protect your skin from environmental damage (such as UV exposure).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Earning perfect 5 out of 5's in every test, this mask feels and looks great on the skin, and hydrates beautifully keeping your lips soft and moisturized for hours. It's a good balance between a lip jelly and a cream without the product feeling too heavy or light. It spreads easily with the included applicator and absorbs in about 30 minutes. Once absorbed you can still feel the hydrating effects of the lip mask, but the coating isn't sticky or tacky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it's marketed as an overnight mask, it has a slight glossy appearance and a subtle pink tint. It almost looks like lip gloss so you could definitely wear this during the day if you wanted. We noticed a berry fragrance which smelled lovely, but could be too strong for some folks. Whether you use it overnight or during the day before you apply makeup, this lip mask will make your lips look and feel radiant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it held up:</strong> After six months of use, we're still loving the glossy look and hydrating feel of this lip mask, and it has officially become part of our daily routine.

We think the day mask feels like a balm, while the night mask is stickier. Both masks have a gel-like feel. The box doesn't indicate it, but the honey-based mask is for day wear, and the cherry mask is for night. We rated the day mask a perfect score in feel, hydration, and look, with the night mask following closely with a near-perfect score.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both masks gave our lips instant hydration, and could be used under another lip product like a matte lipstick. While we appreciated the honey-themed applicator, it wasn't the most practical for applying the lip mask due to its shape. Considering the hydrating effects, nourishing ingredients, and bargain price, this lip mask is ideal for those on a budget.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it held up: </strong>Six months into home-testing, our team still uses this mask and loves the extra moisture, as well as the smooth consistency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.35 oz.

It's designed to use around the lip contour and hydrate any areas with fine lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved the key ingredients like hyaluronic acid and organic extracts and the included applicator made applying the product easier.

We only had to use a small amount, so this product should last for some time — and there's a travel size if you want to take it on the go.

Our team loved the smooth, creamy texture of this mask — enhanced by ingredients like shea butter. Though it doesn't have an applicator, the mask was easy to apply and a little went a long way.

This dreamy lip mask works wonders on chapped lips — it's thick and tacky, almost like Vaseline, and coats your lips to completely soothe any irritation. If you're looking for a lighter mask, this one might be too heavy, but it works well, and when applied overnight as intended, its thick appearance isn't an issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we removed the mask, our lips felt extremely smooth, soft, and hydrated. The packaging didn't come with an applicator, which was disappointing because this formula is a little messy given its thick and sticky consistency.

We used it overnight as instructed, but also occasionally as a daytime lip balm. We actually love the thick formula — it's almost like a blanket of hydration for your lips. The moisture lasts throughout the day. We do wish it had an applicator still, but as long as we wash our hands before and after application, it's not an issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.5 oz. | <strong>Consistency:</strong> Creamy |<strong> Fragrance: </strong>Yes, chamomile-scented | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, chamomile, honey, vanilla | <strong>Overnight Mask: </strong>Yes | <strong>Duration: </strong>Overnight, or throughout the day as needed</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Jessica Juliao</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scented-jouer-cosmetics-overnight-conditioning--repairing-lip-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Scented</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jouer Cosmetics Overnight Conditioning Lip Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Jouer Overnight Conditioning & Repairing Lip Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/FTljLC5N4vqv7YgbkN4yova2pRQ=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/s2189843-main-zoom-de8fab3e3ac54967af5577345bca53d4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Sephora</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This reparative conditioning lip mask is the perfect overnight companion for your lips — especially if you love a soothing fragrance to help you fall asleep.

With a similar consistency to vaseline, this jelly-like formula is super hydrating and reparative for dry, irritated skin. The formula wasn't super sticky and it comes with an applicator to make it easier (and cleaner) to apply to your lips.

To start, you should look for ingredients that moisturize. "These include humectants — which bring water in, like a sponge — and occlusive ingredients like petrolatum, [which] seals in the moisture the humectant brought in," says Dr. Stevenson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She adds that other ingredients like "antioxidants and peptides" can repair damage from and protect against environmental factors like UV rays.

You should consider both types of masks depending on the intensity of hydration and long-term results you're looking for. For perpetually dry lips, perhaps consider wearing overnight masks — like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SHE LOVES 2PCS Lip Mask Overnight</a> — regularly to maintain moisture.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lip Masks vs. Lip Balms</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing that might get confusing when looking for a lip mask is its similarity to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lip balm</a>.

Measuring feel, hydration, and the overall look of our lips after use, our team found several lip masks that earned the title "best". Starting with clean product-free skin, our team applied the lip masks following the unique instructions for each. We rated the masks on how they felt on the skin (hydrating! creamy! sticky! tacky!) when applied. Our team set timers for each mask and observed how well they sat on the skin during the process. Were they dripping? Locked in place? After the set time, we washed the mask off and puckered up to admire the results — such as signs of hydration and softness. We continued testing these lip masks at home for six months and considered these insights as well — and actually removed several of our original picks that scored well in our lab tests but didn't produce the same results over time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>FAQs</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do lip masks really work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, lip masks are loaded with nourishing ingredients that hydrate and moisturize lips.
