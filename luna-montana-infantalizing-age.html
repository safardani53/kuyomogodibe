The first photo captured her in a seated position, taken from an overhead perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, in the photo, she was dressed in a yellow crop top paired with a yellow mini skirt, complemented by two ribbon ties adorning both sides of her hair.</p><p>In the same post, the YouTuber included other pictures depicting her drawing, taking mirror selfies, playing the piano with an array of yellow flowers in her hair, and even going shopping for wool.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the post, Montana accompanied it with a simple caption, “And it was all yellow.” Even though the YouTuber had shared a simple post to go along with the yellow theme, she faced backlash for being like a child in the post’s comment section.&nbsp;</p><p>One person remarked, “Fetish baiting for clicks and followers, it grosses me out,” while another wrote, “It’s so disturbing when grown women infantilize themselves for the male gaze.”</p><p>Likewise, in one comment, a person expressed that he had no issue with Montana wearing a mini skirt, but rather, his concern arose from the combination of elements such as ribbons, pigtails, a childlike top adorned with little flowers, and her gaze towards the camera with what he perceived as child-like vibes.&nbsp;</p><p>This individual stated that the picture gave him the impression of sexualizing childlike attributes. In closing, he advised the YouTuber to avoid combining these elements simultaneously.</p><p>Moreover, another individual left a comment expressing her strong dislike for the post. She found the combination of Cottagecore and Lolita styles peculiar and made her resemble a child. This person also expressed a desire for such content to be prohibited on social media platforms.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After the controversy, the official page of The Tea Talk shared a screenshot of Montana’s post, along with screenshots of various comments made by people in response to the post.&nbsp;</p><p>In the accompanying caption, the page stated, “Fans seem to believe that #lunamontana is engaging in infantilization in her most recent Instagram post,” and inquired about people’s thoughts on the situation.</p><p>Upon seeing the post, numerous fans of Montana rushed to her defense. One supporter remarked, “There’s nothing wrong with the post; people are just overly fixated on the internet,” while another individual pointed out, “Since it was brought up, since when is a crop top made for children?”</p><p>A social media user even commented that in today’s world, people tend to find fault in almost anything. This person preferred to disconnect from the internet and reconnect with nature.</p><p>Following the controversy that surrounded Montana, many of her followers expressed curiosity about her real age and her family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luna Montana appears younger than her actual age&nbsp;</h2><p>Montana was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">born</a> on January 15, 2001, which makes her 22 years old as of 2023. Despite being in her twenties, she appears significantly younger, possibly owing to her consistent skincare routine.</p><p>She has shared many skincare and makeup routines on her YouTube channel. For example, on April 13, 2018, Montana uploaded a video titled “SKINCARE AND LIPS ROUTINE.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/skincare.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Luna Montana has maintained a consistent skincare routine throughout the years. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>)</p><p>In the video, she began her skincare routine by using wipes to remove her makeup. Next, she used Neutrogena foaming face wash to cleanse her face and followed it up with a toner.</p><p>Continuing her routine, she demonstrated the use of a lip scrub to exfoliate her lips, leaving them soft and smooth. Montana then applied moisturizer and day cream before finishing off with lip balm.</p><p>However, since the video was uploaded five years ago, her skincare routine might have evolved. While she hasn’t provided an updated skincare routine, she has continued to share <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videos</a> showcasing her makeup routine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luna Montana’s parents divorced when she was at a young age&nbsp;</h2><p>Montana was born in Los Angeles, California, United States. However, she has not disclosed the names of her parents nor shared any details about them.</p><p>She has also refrained from posting any pictures of her parents. However, on February 1, 2023, the YouTuber uploaded a video that compiled clips from her childhood to her adult years.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In the video, she provided a voiceover, reflecting on her journey, saying, “I think the best form of therapy for me is looking back at these little videos and remembering that golden little girl, full of laughter and always smiling.”</p><p>Montana then shared that during her childhood, she was carefree and didn’t dwell on the future or the past; she lived in the moment. She also mentioned that she didn’t anticipate her parents’ divorce, nor did she foresee having to become fully self-reliant at the age of 18.</p><p>Moreover, she went on to express her satisfaction with her current life, sharing that she has purchased her own home through hard work and is living a happy life.</p><p>Regarding her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">siblings</a>, the YouTuber has been reported to have a brother named Max Montana, who is a basketball player, and a sister named Zolita Montana, who is a pop singer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luna Montana started her career at a young age</h2><p>Montana began her dance journey at the age of 3, with a particular interest in tap dancing.
