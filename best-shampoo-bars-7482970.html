But since most of us have spent a lifetime using traditional bottled shampoos, this particular product switch can feel like a big one. To figure out which are most worthy of the swap, we tested 21 shampoo bars, evaluating products for ease of use, performance, comfort, and durability. We loved 6 of them enough to give them top honors in our testing — with two of the winners even earning a perfect score.

It's a good size and easy to hold (and, interestingly, is hand-cut, so no two bars are exactly the same).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester has thick, fine hair and a sensitive scalp, which typically requires a large amount of regular liquid shampoo. In our testing, she found that this bar solved the overuse problem beautifully. Not only was it easy to use, but rubbing it directly into her hair produced an impressive lather and effective clean. During testing, she even found that her scalp was much “happier” (read: less irritated and dry) with this bar than with anything she had ever tried before. She was even able to go more days without washing her hair than she usually does which is a win for preventing dryness and easing your routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This unscented bar was incredibly gentle and oil-balancing on her combination and flaky scalp (other bars have resulted in an itchy scalp and oily hair for our tester). After seven washes, the bar barely looked used. We think it would not only replace shampoo bottles but will ultimately require less frequent purchasing. Plus, it’s 100 percent biodegradable, which makes for an even more conscious purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only complaint: Both the shampoo bar and the conditioner are the same shape and color so it’s a bit hard to tell them apart.

It’s also got shea butter, cocoa butter, and coconut to help condition and soften the hair to help keep curls defined and healthy. To that last point, the coconut scent mixed with light citrus notes were found to be delightful in our testing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During the two-week test, we found that this shampoo bar created a rich lather that easily refreshed our tester’s oily scalp.

She typically notices that her scalp gets oily pretty quickly, but even several days after washing with Ethique Professor Curl Curl-Defining Solid Shampoo Bar, she didn’t feel that she was in need of a wash or refresh. One note: her scalp was a bit drier than usual after several washes, though that could be due to more frequent hair washing for the sake of this test rather than a fault of the product itself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Ethique Professor bar dried quickly after use and still looked new after two weeks.

Enough said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After using this unscented bar three or four times a week, the product looked like it had never even been touched.

Ten washes in, this durable little bar looked brand new and even several washes after that, it did not change in shape or consistency. We feel confident in getting a few months of washes out of it.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since we have fine and oily hair, this particular product was not the best match (our tester felt more oily than usual the next day). However, it delivers on its promises for reviving dry, dehydrated hair and is clearly a good match for that hair type. We'd recommend it to anyone with dryness or damage. It's also a great value in that the creamy lather is intended for the body as well, so you can kill two birds with one stone.</p><p><strong>Weight: </strong>3.5 ounces | <strong>Scent:</strong> n/a | <strong>Hair Type:</strong> All; especially dehydrated, dull hair</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-shampoo-bar></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Shampoo Bar</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most shampoo bars are on par with or less expensive than moderately-priced bottled shampoos. However, since they are designed to last a whole lot longer, you really can't go wrong anywhere in the price range. Bars, quite simply, provide more bang for your buck, "as long as you keep them away from water between washes," adds L.A.-based beauty and lifestyle content creator Kaelyn Gutierrez.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hair Type&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shampoo bars are generally less specific in targeting hair types than bottled shampoos. "Most shampoo bars cater to all hair types," notes beauty influencer Joy Villa. But as with any product, the proof is in the results you get after several washes. The keyword here is “several”—your hair will need time to adapt to the use of a shampoo bar, like any new product. So if your hair doesn't feel amazing after the first few washes, we suggest sticking it out for a week or two. Once your hair has adapted, you'll get a better sense of whether a product is a good fit for you. As with any shampoo, oily hair types should stay away from other oily ingredients, while dry hair will drink that right up. "Shampoo bars with extra conditioning ingredients would be good for curly or dry hair," adds Villa. "And one that’s more clear in appearance will be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best for oily hair</a>."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scent</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You'll generally find fewer artificial fragrances in shampoo bars than bottled shampoo. We consider this a big plus, as fragrance (or "parfum" on an ingredient label) can be irritating to the scalp, just like it can be on the skin. Many of the shampoo bars we tested were unscented or contained natural rather than artificial fragrance. "I prefer no artificial fragrances. The closer to nature, the better!" says Villa. However, some natural essential oils, like citrus, can actually irritate the scalp, so it’s all about trial and error. And if you've spent a lifetime to date using bottled shampoos — which typically contain fragrance — the shift to a more natural scent in a shampoo bar can be a jarring one. Again, give it time. You might find that you prefer the more natural scent after several washes.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Key Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone looking to moisturize should keep an eye out for certain oils and other hair-friendly ingredients. By many accounts, coconut oil, argan oil, and avocado oil are great for dry hair types, as are cocoa butter and shea butter. Villa recommends coconut oil specifically ("I love a creamy coconut bar") and adds that mint is a great ingredient for an invigorating wash. "Look for a bar that has the simplest ingredients," she says. Botanical extracts, proteins, and vitamins are all great for hair as well. Villa and other experts recommend avoiding shampoo bars that contain sulfates, which can strip the hair of essential oils.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Allison Vancura</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><br>Our testers evaluated 21 shampoo bars over a period of two weeks, ditching their regular shampoo in place of the bars. Before we even began washing our hair with the shampoo bars, we implemented a spot test where we rubbed the bars on our elbows and placed a bandaid over the area for 24 hours to ensure there was no allergic reaction to the ingredients. Once cleared, we then got to work cleansing our hair with just the bars, ensuring no other shampoos or hair masks were being used during the testing period. The testers also took photos of the bars before and after the two-week trial to evaluate the bars’ durability and longevity. After two weeks of washes, we rated each bar's ease of use, performance, comfort, and durability. Each attribute was given a score of 1-5 and the numerical scoring was taken into consideration along with the individual testers' comments. Our overall winner and our Best for Fine Hair winner both earned perfect scores across all the attributes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-1bc7ddce-a772-4f0f-8aa9-33e0f4c5a7e8></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=51.699049193882><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97723577235772><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you use a shampoo bar vs traditional bottled shampoo?</span></p><p>To use a shampoo bar, you should first read the manufacturer’s instructions, as some bars differ from others. Generally speaking, though, run the bar on top of wet hair until it lathers, and then work it around in a lather on the rest of the hair. A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalp massager</a> can help lather up the shampoo. If you prefer, you can also lather the bar in your hands first and then apply it to your hair like you would with bottled shampoo. There is some trial and error involved here, but after several uses, you'll find the best way to get a great lather going.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the benefits of bar shampoo over bottled?</span></p><p>Bar shampoo is easier to use, great for travel, and generally lasts longer than shampoo bottles. "A good bar can last you months, as opposed to a bottle which uses plastic and can add to environmental waste. They outlast most bottles," adds Villa. "The containers are usually made of recyclable materials, and they can even double as a body wash in a pinch. The environment will thank you tremendously if you switch to a shampoo bar!"</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long should a good bar shampoo last?</span></p><p>A little goes a long way, the experts tell us. Gutierrez estimates you get about 60-80 washes out of a shampoo bar. To stretch the life of your shampoo bar, place it somewhere in your shower where it won't get wet between uses. Think of it like bar soap in that regard — if it's constantly getting spray from the showerhead, it won't last as long. Find a relatively dry spot to preserve the life of your bar.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do you need conditioner after using a shampoo bar?</span></p><p><br>It depends on your hair type. Some of those who tested these products noted that they needed conditioner after using a shampoo bar, while others were satisfied with how clean and soft their hair felt after using a shampoo bar only. The experts tell us that, generally speaking, conditioner of some kind is necessary, just as with regular shampoo.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can bar shampoos be used with all hair types?</span></p><p>"Bar shampoos are extremely effective and very versatile,” says Villa. They can be used for textured hair, straight, thin, dry, or oily hair — it’s all about the ingredients you use.” She suggests looking for coconut oil or jojoba for dry or textured hair and no fragrances for sensitive skin. For oily hair, a deeper clean may be necessary, like kaolin clay as well as a lightweight moisturizer like aloe vera.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rennie Dyball</a> is an award-winning author who began her career at PEOPLE in 2002 as a reporter and remained on staff until 2017; she now regularly freelances for the brand.
